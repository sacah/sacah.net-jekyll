Requiring a career change from working in an office at a computer all day, I enquired about joining the QAS(Queensland ambulance Service). After 5 phone calls with voice messages, 3 emails and nearly 2 months later I get an email reply from the recruitment line. Email didn't really have any answers in it so I give them another ring and get straight onto someone who answers my question. Every time I call or email after that I get replies, so maybe they just went through a busy patch, probably need more government funding.<br /><br />I've repeatedly asked roughly how long each step, or even how many steps there are and all I get told is read the PDFs on the website. The PDFs don't really cover much, though they had been updated since I first look, but still didn't outline the process thoroughly. My main question was how long does the process take, so I can give work an indication about how long I'll be around for, finally I get an answer that on average its 6-8months, and applications are valid for 3years.<br /><br />So I'm blogging my journey here as a source of information for everyone else.
