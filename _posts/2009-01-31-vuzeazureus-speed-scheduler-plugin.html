Most ISPs give you a different amount of bandwidth for Peak and Off Peak times. Mine is 9am to 1am is Peak, 1am to 9am is Off Peak. Given I'm not up at 1am to turn my torrents on, or raise the minimum download speed I searched around and found a brilliant plugin called 'Speed Scheduler'. It let's you define different time periods and set Max Up and Down speeds for this time preiod, or pause uploads or downloads all together.<br /><br />I did have to set 2 rules, one from 9am to 11:59pm and another from midnight to 1am, these 2 rules have a minimum download of 7kib/ps, which means I just have enough Peak quota to make the month when combined with my other browsing. And all my torrents run full speed just in Off Peak times, allowing my to utilise most of my Off Peak quota too.<br /><br />In Vuze, goto 'Tools'->'Plugins'->'Get Plugins' and it will be downloadable from the website.<br /><br />Update:<br />I've been using uTorrent for a while now, it's much better than Vuze, smaller memory footprint and an easy to use scheduler built in. I'd recommend trying it out.
