After all the talk of their great broadband plan, the Rudd government is now trying to palm it off to Telstra. Telstra showing their true colours said they won't help unless they have full control over it. If they had full control we would be no better off than we currently are, as this high speed network would be priced out of reach from most ISPs, limiting us to Bigpond with a 5gb per month cap.<div> </div><div>I think Rudd would have better luck floating the idea to some smaller ISPs/Telcos (Agile, Primus, Nextep, PowerTel etc) who have shown initiative in rolling out ADSL2. They would have the knowledge to plan and complete this project without the money hungry, control everything attitude of Telstra.</div><div> </div><div>I don't think one company could handle this whole process, but dividing Australia up and allocating areas to different companies, all managed under the same committee at government level should see the task completed to a common standard.</div><div> </div><div>I hope and pray that the Rudd government takes the ball on this one and plan to deliver what they promised and does not take the easy route and give the project to Telsta, which will give us a solution no better than we are currently in, maybe even worse.<br /><br />Do you know of another good ISP/Telco that could help plan/deliver this?
