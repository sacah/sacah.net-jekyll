My application was received on 30 Apr, on the 5th of May they emailed me saying I needed to supply more information. I had written my job history, but had no official letters from employers verifying my work history. I couldn't find any instruction on what to do if you didn't have any supporting documents so I sent it away.<br /><br />When they sent it back to me they said if I didn't have supporting documents, I could fill out a Stat Dec(Statutory Declaration) of my history, so if you don't have supporting documents, fill out the Stat Dec first and send it away to avoid delays in application process.<br /><br />Today my application was accepted, next step is the Aptitude and Psychometric Assessments, there are 3-4 of them each month in Brisbane and every few months on the Gold Coast. Unfortunately the Gold Coast ones are fully booked, so the next available one is in Brisbane in about 5 weeks.
