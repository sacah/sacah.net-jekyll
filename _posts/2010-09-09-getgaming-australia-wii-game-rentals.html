While downloading some demos from <a href="http://www.ausgamers.com/">AusGamers </a>I saw an ad for <a href="http://www.getgaming.com.au/">GetGaming Australia</a>, they are a company similar to Netflix or Bigpond Movies where you rent games, they send them to you via mail and once you've finished you send them back by the included return envelope. You can keep them for as long or short a time as you like.<br /><br />I've done the DVD renting this way a few times before, but never had enough DVDs in my queue and frequently didn't get anything as others hadn't returned them yet, but so far with the Wii games it's been different, I've found 35 games to add to my queue, which at 2-3 per week will last me quite a while, and by then I'm sure new games will be out to keep me going.<br /><br />Compared to the $7 for an overnight Wii game rental at my local video store, $31/month for unlimited rentals, with 2 out at a time is great, so far I'm getting 2 a week, which works out to $3.50 per game, and I can keep them for 4-5 days, though if I get a dog of a game and send it back straight away I might do 3 games some weeks.<br /><br />Great idea, they also have PS3, XBox360, PC, DS, PS2 and PSP games for rent all via the same rental plans. Not sure how the prices compare but you can also buy the games direct from them.
