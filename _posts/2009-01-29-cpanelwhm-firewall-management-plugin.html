I searched around quite a bit trying to find a plugin/addon for cPanel/WHM that would allow me to control iptables. Finally I found this amazing free product from a company that offer server setups. I am just blogging it here so others can hopefully find it, as their company does not rank well on google for the keywords I was searching for.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.configserver.com/cp/csf.html">http://www.configserver.com/cp/csf.html</a><br /><br />If you like it, make sure you donate, it's great to see these companies offering this for free.
