GFX files are basically SWFs, to edit them rename them to a *.swf file and with a hex editor change the first 3 bytes from CFX to CWS, then any Flash Decompiler will happily open them.<br /><br />I've opened them up and inspected the Actionscript which all worked though I'm yet to try editing one, my guess is you should just be able to change the first 3 bytes back to CFX and rename it back to an *.gfx file for it to work, though depending how it modifies the SWF it might break something extra that GFX files have that SWF doesn't.<br /> <br />Let me know if you've had any success, or more info, I'll update this post as I find out more.
