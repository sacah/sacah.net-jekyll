We are all booked to spend 10 nights in Port Vila, Vanuatu over Christmas. Should be an exciting holiday. Just a note, be careful about Travel Agents, always do your own research to confirm what they say. Last time I used a Travel Agent we were going to New Zealand, they told us it snowed all year round and we could go anytime and ski. Very wrong. This time I though I'd give them another go, different travel agent mind you, about 200km apart (-:<br />This group of travel agents I asked about booking a holiday to Vanuatu told me everything was sold out and I had no hope of getting there over Christmas.<br /><br />So I went home and found many flights with Pacific Blue and Air Vanuatu still available, and as for accommodation, everything I looked at was available in both Port Vila and on the island of Espiritu Santo. <br /><br />If your looking to plan your own trip to Vanuatu, I highly recommend visiting <a href="http://www.vanuatu-hotels.vu/">vanuatu-hotels.vu</a> to look through all the accommodation and to book, they were quite helpful when I had some questions and got me a better deal with the accommodation. All up it worked out better than lastminute rates for the same hotel.<br /><br />I have also ordered the <a href="http://www.rocket-guide-vanuatu.com/">The Rocket Guide to Vanuatu</a>, which I will get in 7-10days. Look forward to seeing how much useful info it has.
