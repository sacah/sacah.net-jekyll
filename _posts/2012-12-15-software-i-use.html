So I've just done a fresh Format/Install, figured I'd document the tools I've grown a collection of over the years.  <br /><br /><a href="http://www.displayfusion.com/">DisplayFusion</a><br /><blockquote>Purchased. I couldn't live without this, task bars on each monitor, unbelievably useful. If you don't think so, you either don't have 20 applications open at once, or don't know what your missing. Download the demo and try it. The other features are neat, but I rarely use them.</blockquote><a href="http://ditto-cp.sourceforge.net/">Ditto</a><br /><blockquote>Free. Clipboard manager, store a ton of copies, and let you select the one you want to paste with a simple hotkey. I use this a ton while programming, but still find it useful when I'm not coding.</blockquote><a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/add-take-ownership-to-explorer-right-click-menu-in-vista/">Take Ownership</a><br /><blockquote>Free. Registry hack that adds a 'Take Ownership' option to your right click menu. I use this when I copy files from a previous install of Windows, resets the permissions to me on my current install.</blockquote><a href="http://codesector.com/teracopy">TeraCopy</a><br /><blockquote>Free. Windows Copy Replacement. Fantastic replacement, cut/copy files and folders like normal, and on paste it will queue your files, and perform the copy. Has error handling, so no more broken copies halfway through, and seems to copy slightly faster. Amazingly well done program, and some of their Android tools are pretty awesome too.</blockquote><a href="http://event.msi.com/vga/afterburner/overview.htm">MSI Afterburner</a><br /><blockquote>Free. AMD VISION Engine Control Center replacement. Light weight, amazing fan control. This is so good I'd buy an MSI card over other comparable cards.</blockquote><a href="http://www.avast.com/">avast!</a><br /><blockquote>Free. Great and light weight antivirus scanner. Does a great job, all the features you want, none of the bloat you don't. It does offer to install Chrome, I select this option as I use both Firefox and Chrome, and it gives avast! some money from Google.</blockquote><a href="http://www.piriform.com/defraggler/">Defraggler</a><br /><blockquote>Free. Great defragmenter, see fragmented files, choose which ones to defragment. Super simple and works a treat.</blockquote><a href="http://www.videolan.org/">VLC Player</a><br /><blockquote>Free. The best media player, light, powerful, great to use. Nothing comes close to VLC.</blockquote><a href="http://www.tightvnc.com/">TightVNC</a><br /><blockquote>Free. Great Windows VNC server, small and fast with a multi-platform client(Java).</blockquote><a href="http://www.irfanview.com/">Irfanview</a><br /><blockquote>Free. The best image viewer ever. Reads almost everything, has some great adjustment controls and it's batch mode is simple and fast.</blockquote><a href="http://www.7-zip.org/">7-Zip</a><br /><blockquote>Free. Compression tool, reads/writes ZIPs, TARs, GZIPs and a range of other formats. Lightweight, does a great job.</blockquote><br /><a href="http://jagt.github.io/clumsy/index.html">clumsy</a><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">&nbsp;Simulates bad/laggy networks on Windows at the network driver level, so no need for proxy server settings etc.</blockquote>
