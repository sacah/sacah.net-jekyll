Three of us tried the Don't Bit Me patch on our recent camping trip, they were a great success. Two of us trying them are frequently bitten when outdoors, but we didn't sustain a single mosquito bite this camping trip.<br />Was also great not to have Aeroguard on all night.<br /><br />The patches cost about $1.20 each and last 36hours, plus they are water proof and clear so not very noticable. If your just going outdoors for a few hours, I'd just spray myself and have a shower once I'm back indoors, but for long term exposure to insects like camping they are worth the money.<br /><br />Apparently they will be in stores soon, then the price should go down too, but for now you can grab them at <a href="http://www.dontbiteme.com.au/">www.dontbiteme.com.au </a>
