UPDATED - <a href="http://sacah.blogspot.com/2008/12/updated-ir-button.html">Here</a><br /><br />I've been looking into building underwater camera enclosures lately. Most DIY versions have no method of controlling the device once it's enclosure is water tight, the 2 exceptions I saw was one using a soap dispenser pump head to push a button and the other was a professional enclosure using metal leavers to manipulate controls.<br /><br />I don't have an old camera I am willing to risk to build this with, but I'd use 2 servos, you should be able to pick 2 up from ebay for under $15. One will control zooming and the other control the Rec/Stop button. These can be controlled by a simple, easy to use PICAXE.<br /><br />As for how to activate these servos, I wanted a non contact button so everything could be water tight, so I opted for an IR reflective button. Simply use 2 IR LEDs, both angled toward a center point as shown below.<br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_-gckRFXob4c/ST-G7GEVg3I/AAAAAAAAADw/ucM9Aj8XlHI/s1600-h/ir_button2.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; cursor: pointer; width: 134px; height: 197px;" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_-gckRFXob4c/ST-G7GEVg3I/AAAAAAAAADw/ucM9Aj8XlHI/s200/ir_button2.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5278085638100714354" border="0" /></a><br /><br /><br />Connect one to power and the other to the analogue pin of the PICAXE and when your finger moves over the top it will detect the IR reflecting off your finger. I added a small pipe to help block outside light. Adding a filter that blocks anything but IR light will give a much better result as direct sunlight will set this button off too, but underwater I figured there won't be much direct light so it should be safe.<br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_-gckRFXob4c/ST-G7Kat9wI/AAAAAAAAADo/o-FSrJpBiZ0/s1600-h/ir_button.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; cursor: pointer; width: 135px; height: 200px;" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_-gckRFXob4c/ST-G7Kat9wI/AAAAAAAAADo/o-FSrJpBiZ0/s200/ir_button.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5278085639268333314" border="0" /></a><br /><br />The video below shows it working connected to a PICAXE, it lights the green LED when it senses over 200 on the analogue pin, which is connected to the detector IR LED. Sorry for distorted aspect, I'm still learning how to use this funny JVC software with my camera.<br /><object width="425" height="344"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/zeDGX58pVUg&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1"><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/zeDGX58pVUg&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="425" height="344"></embed></object>
