Edit: With Wesabes interface update script no longer works.<br /><br /><a href="http://sacah.blogspot.com/2008/09/greasemonkey-script-for-wesabecom.html">Read about Wesabe in my first scripts post</a><br /><br />When you do a search for a tag I wanted it to calculate if you were spending more or less than you were earning. So I wrote this little script. I am pulling out dates along with each tag. I would like to graph each spend/earn eventually like on the Accounts page but I couldn't figure out how to tap into the graphs that Wesabe already use. <br /><br />While the script can handle case differences in the Tag used on the transaction and the tag searched for, it can't handle more than 1 search tag. This is another feature I'll be adding soon. Most likely before graphing.<br /><br />Here you will see my transactions, $5 is added to the Ent tag through the use of Splits.<br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_-gckRFXob4c/SNEI8-_oTPI/AAAAAAAAAC4/FXdNV1yBnC4/s1600-h/wesabe_sumSearch_without.jpg"><img style="cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_-gckRFXob4c/SNEI8-_oTPI/AAAAAAAAAC4/FXdNV1yBnC4/s200/wesabe_sumSearch_without.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5246984884658392306" /></a><br /><br />And here you will see it has added together all spending and all earnings for the searched tag.<br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_-gckRFXob4c/SNEJPUAC7NI/AAAAAAAAADA/i-mJxlBpdeI/s1600-h/wesabe_sumSearch_with.jpg"><img style="float:left; margin:0 10px 10px 0;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_-gckRFXob4c/SNEJPUAC7NI/AAAAAAAAADA/i-mJxlBpdeI/s200/wesabe_sumSearch_with.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5246985199534927058" /></a>
