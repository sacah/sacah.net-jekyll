&nbsp;I wanted this game since buying the Wii but at $99 and only 1 player there were other games higher on the list. While browsing through Dick Smiths sale the other night I found a copy marked down to $30, and it included the MotionPlus! Purchased it was!<br /><br />I've played it for a few hours and think it's greatly constructed and planned out well. The difficulty in controls that I found initially with Metroid Prime 3 have been overcome in this game by taking some control off you. And the auto targeting system really helped my get the hang of using the Wiimote rather than a mouse for FPS.<br /><br />The action is pretty constant, with increasing hardness and there are plenty of things to smash, shot or crack along the way to keep the action flowing. There is a perfect blend of movement to button pushing controls and the safe cracking really adds some fun without going overboard.<br /><br />The training system to teach you how to do all the moves is well constructed, fun to do and pretty good at helping you remember the combination. The map system it very easy to follow to your quest destinations, and onscreen prompts to aid you are well signed and easy to understand most time. There are a few glitches like an on-screen prompt appearing when the object is through walls, or one point I fell off buildings and plunged deep into blackness, but didn't die. All in all, I'd have to play it some more to tell you if it would be worth $99, $30 it was a steal, and so far I think it would be worth the $99.
