I was interested in seeing what all the fuss was with these Rabbids, and thought I was in some something awesome when it got the the starting bit with the Rabbid inside the Wiimote.<br /><br />Once the game started I found it quite easy to figure out the controls and get around, it was cute and funny but got old very quickly. After 46 minutes I turned it off and was very thankful I'd only rented it. It's probably good for kids skill level, though not sure if you want kids controlling a g-string wearing rabbit who scares peoples clothes off.<br /><br />After a few levels I found it didn't get more challening, no new abilities, or puzzles, just the same old same old.<br /><br />Good for a bit of a laugh, not much else.
