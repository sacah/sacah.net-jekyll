I was trying to mount a samba share from ArchLinux, this share is unsecured, with a username of guest.<br /><br />I tried a range of options<br />mount.cifs -o guest //ip/hdd /mnt/hdd<br />mount.cifs -o username=guest //ip/hdd /mnt/hdd<br />mount.cifs -o username=guest,password= /ip/hdd /mnt/hdd<br /><br />Plus a bunch of other iterations and I kept getting<br />'mount error(13): Permission denied'<br /><br />After a bunch of searching I found a post that said you sometimes need to include sec=ntlm, and with this I got it to work<br /><br />mount.cifs -o username=guest,sec=ntlm //ip/hdd /mnt/hdd<br /><br /><br />
