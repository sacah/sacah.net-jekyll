You know how funny those knock knock jokes are at 3am, or at 4am how balancing the family dog on your nose sounds like a great an idea.<br /><br />Our politicians are making decisions that effect every person in our nation in this same frame of mind. No one can make clear decisions working for the long hours they consistently do. Makes sense why so many bills pass, then defeated a few weeks later.<br /><br />Given the massive amount of hours they need to listen to policy and debate it, I don't think they are over paid, but think they could do a better job with better working conditions.<br /><br />Why not pay politicians less, give them set working hours and make sure they can get enough sleep to properly guide our nation.
