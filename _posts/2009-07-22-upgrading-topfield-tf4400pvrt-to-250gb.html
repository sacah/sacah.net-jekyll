<div>Bought the PVR off eBay a few years back, came with a 80gb IDE harddrive. There is not a whole lot on TV I watch so 80gb was more than enough for my needs. With the new Free to Air stations though, I've found at times I've filled the drive. Mainly during cricket season.</div><br /><div>I had a 250gb SATA drive that was in my home made computer PVR before its motherboard packe it in, so rather than buy a new IDE HDD I looked for ways to use this one. I found an IDE to SATA converter on eBay for ~$7 delivered, only problem was the IDE connector was under the HDD mount, even if I moved the HDD the converter sat too high to put the PVR lid back on. So I soldered together 2 male to male IDE connectors and plugged 2 IDE cabled into each other, which aligned the pins the right way and let me move the converter to under the HDD mount.</div><br /><div>A better solution would have been to solder an IDE cable onto and male IDE connector, to properly align the pins, but I don't have a wire stripper for wires that small and couldn't be bothered stripping 40 wires with a knife and soldering the 40 small wires either.</div><br /><div>I noticed how hot the 80gb HDD got, knowing a 250gb HDD would get hotter which would lead to early failure, I decided to add a fan while I did the upgrade too. I soldered the fan wires onto the power connector of the SATA converter.</div><br /><div class="image"><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_-gckRFXob4c/SmcClyD_QOI/AAAAAAAAAFw/Zb3cWWEhUpQ/s1600-h/pvr_hdd_upgrade1.jpg"><img style="cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 200px; height: 150px;" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_-gckRFXob4c/SmcClyD_QOI/AAAAAAAAAFw/Zb3cWWEhUpQ/s200/pvr_hdd_upgrade1.jpg" border="0" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5361256729524781282" /></a><div>Converter connected to 2 IDE cables and hacked connectors</div></div><div class="image"><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_-gckRFXob4c/SmcDxQMgOnI/AAAAAAAAAF4/kEw0JPTzOM0/s1600-h/pvr_hdd_upgrade2.jpg"><img style="cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 200px; height: 150px;" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_-gckRFXob4c/SmcDxQMgOnI/AAAAAAAAAF4/kEw0JPTzOM0/s200/pvr_hdd_upgrade2.jpg" border="0" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5361258026103749234" /></a><div>Cable folded and fan attached.</div></div><div class="image"><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_-gckRFXob4c/SmcEC0NBtrI/AAAAAAAAAGA/b67zQjqUjNs/s1600-h/pvr_hdd_upgrade3.jpg"><img style="cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 200px; height: 150px;" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_-gckRFXob4c/SmcEC0NBtrI/AAAAAAAAAGA/b67zQjqUjNs/s200/pvr_hdd_upgrade3.jpg" border="0" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5361258327827396274" /></a><div>HDD mounted</div></div>
