Well, posted a error report in the Forum over at http://www.usbeeforum.com/viewtopic.php?f=12&amp;t=27 Took them a few days to get back to me, but they asked for the saved file of the capture that is causing the crashing and within a few hour of them looking at it they had a diagnosis, they are working to fix the problem. I've been pretty happy with their response times, never nice to experience problems with a product you purchased, but having a company that is wiling to keep improving it's product is great.<br /><br />I'm looking forward to getting this latest capture working, will help with the latest project I'm working on.
