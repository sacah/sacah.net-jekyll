My wife and I have been living in the apartment complex at 104 Miller st, Pyrmont, NSW for over 4 years now. We've split our time between a large 1 bedroom, and a 2 bedroom once our daughter came along.

~~~fold~~~

The location is amazing, IGA across the road, post office, countless restraunts all within a few minutes walk. Darling Harbour is an easy 10min stroll and the city is a 15min walk. Busses to the Circular Quay and Central station are pretty much at the front door, as is the Light Rail stop.

The apartment has an indoor pool, spa, suana, gym and games room. Pool is solar heated, spa is heated. Gym has some old, some new equipment, and the weights room has what you'd need.

Internet is serviced by a few providers, you'll get between 7000-8000down, 900-1000up. Water pressue is decent, though you'll need to adjust your taps a couple of times during peak times.

The complex is reasonable quite, level 4+ has a nice view of the city and you have bbqs and entertaining areas both in the courtyard and on the roof.
