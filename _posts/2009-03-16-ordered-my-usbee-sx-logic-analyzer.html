After looking at a gazillion websites trying to find the best logic analyser for my money, I settled on the <a href="http://www.usbee.com/sx.html">USBee SX</a>.<br /><br />I've never used a logic analyzer, but I've heard about them and their uses, and their high price tag. While surfing <a href="http://hackaday.com/">Hack a Day</a> I noticed an ad for the <a href="http://www.saleae.com/home/">Saleae Logic</a>, with a price of $149USD, which was reasonable. I went to their site and investigated what it could do, hardware and software  looked great.<br /><br />I figured I'd look around at any Australian distributors, or companies selling other small cheap pc based logic analyzers. Not many Australian companies stocked or distributed cheap pc based logic analysers, the main one I found was the <a href="http://www.poscope.com/">po.Scope</a>, which not only had a logic analyzer, but also a oscilloscope. While my needs for an oscilloscope were very rare, for about $50AUD more than the Saleae I could get the po.Scope with oscilloscope. I noticed the sample rates of the logic analyser on the po.Scope were fairly limited, so I investigated the oscilloscope sample rates and found they were not much use either. A few people I found talking about the po.Scope highlighted it as a great tool for learning, but extremely limited.<br /><br />Knowing that there were cheap logic analyzers with oscilloscopes, I started looking world wide for other products, none were in the price range of the Saleae, so I dumped the idea of getting an oscilloscope too and focused on researching just pc based logic analysers.<br /><span style="font-style: italic;">For those interested in spending a bit more for something with an oscilloscope, look at the </span><a style="font-style: italic;" href="http://www.linkinstruments.com/mso19.htm">MSO-19 from Link Instruments</a><span style="font-style: italic;">. I just couldn't justify the $150+AUD more for my basic needs.</span><br /><br />I found some 16 channel ones on eBay, from China, for about the $300AUD mark. The included software was poorly translated, but included a massive number of bus decoders. If you've used logic analyzers before and are familiar with their workings, these could be a great way to go. Given I've never used one before, I needed something that was in english (-:<br /><br />Next I found the USBee range, I was interested in the SX and AX, after looking at the AX and seeing it was fairly cut down in the basic model, and the higher models being out of my price range, I opted for the SX. I found they had an Austrlaian distributor, Emona Instruments, went to their site and had nothing but trouble trying to navigate through it and find the USBee SX, I was only able to find the AX. I sent them an email asking if they stocked it and a price. They came back saying they could order one in for $440+GST AUD. That was more than I was wanting to spend, so I went back looking for any others, thinking I'd probably settle on the Saleae.<br /><br />I asked an Electronic engineer friend if he'd used any, which he hadn't, but he did a search and asked why I didn't consider USBee. I took another look at their site, and realised I could order it direct from the US company. The USBee SX was priced at $139USD, at the days exchange rate and including the cheapest postage method, it came to about $260AUD, much cheaper than the $484AUD their Austrlaian distributor was charging.<br /><br />It was then out of the Saleae and the USBee SX, both hardware specs are the same for the analyser. The USBee SX can be used as a signal generator, which the Saleae can't.<br />Both have similar looking software, though the USBee has more bus decoders at the moment as you can see <a href="http://www.usbee.com/suite.html">here</a>.<br />Both say they will be releasing new decoders, but USBee is a larger company, and Saleae has stated that until things pick up they can't develop more. So I put more faith in the USBee SX for long term updates.<br />So, $10USD less, signal generator and a more bus decoders, with a promise of more decoders sealed the deal for me.<br /><br />I was pretty impressed, they had shipped my package within 3hrs of me ordering. I should have it in 2 weeks, I'll then post some pics and more info on how I found using a logic analyser for the first time.
