So went to Kickstarter.com as usual and was welcomed with this message "We're sorry, but something went wrong (500)". I figured they had some hicup and figured I'd come back later, a few hours later it was still having issues, but projects I was backing were tweeting about new updates, without a mention of KS being down. Then this morning, still no tweets about it being down and many more messages about KS updates, though the site still gave me a "We're sorry, but something went wrong (500)".   So I opened it in Chrome, and it worked. Back to Firefox, I deleted all the kickstarter.com cookies and boom, Kickstarter was back in action.
