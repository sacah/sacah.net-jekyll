So I found out Monday that I wasn't accepted for the role of Student Paramedic. Quite disappointing as I was looking forward to really helping people full time, seems they put more emphasis on words than actions, not the way I'd structure the application process.<br />Was an interesting experience, remember when dealing with QAS recruitment that there is only 4 staff for the whole of Queensland, so cut them some slack if they don't get back to you straight away, and if it's something you really want to do it's worth all the rigmarole of the application process.<br /><br />Good luck all others who applied (-:
