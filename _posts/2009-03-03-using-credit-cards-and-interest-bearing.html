<p>Credit cards give you an interest free period, usually 45-55days.<br /></p><p>Eg. My credit card month ends on about the 2nd of each month, but I don't need to pay the money back until about the 16th of each month. So if I make a purchase the 3rd, I'll get about 44 days interest free. If I make a purchase on the 1st I'll only get about 14 days interest free.</p><p>By using a credit card where you would normally use cash, and keeping your cash in an interest bearing account until the interest free period has expired, then paying our credit card lets you earn interest on money you have already spent.</p><p>As with any credit, you have to be wise with how you use it. Make sure you have a solid budget in place that you stick too, not using real money makes it harder for you to know when you've over spent. If you over spend and don't pay the credit card back on time, they will charge you much more in interest than you made by having the money in an interest bearing account.</p><p>My credit card interest rate is about 5 times what my interest bearing account is.</p><p>By using this method I make $500-800 a year in interest, currently we use some of this money to sponsor a child, if more people were smart with their money and employed a scheme like this, and used a small portion of it to sponsor a child, or give to a charity, imagine the kind of world we would live in.</p><p><br /></p><p>TIP: I use a site called <a href="http://www.wesabe.com/">Wesabe</a><a href="http://www.wesabe.com/"> to keep track of my budget</a>, it's a great site, plugs into Firefox to allow me to upload my bank history right from my online banking.<br /></p>
