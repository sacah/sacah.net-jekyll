I recently bought some polymorph plastic pellets from Jaycar. I hadn't seen these before, so I was quite excited when I saw them.<br /><br />Many people report using hair dryers or heat guns, these require about 60degerees Celsius to become soft and allow you to mold them.<br /><br />I simple put boiling water into a glass dish and added the number of pellets I needed. Once they turn clear you know it's time to pull them out and start molding them. I used a wooden skewer to group them all together and get them out of the hot water.<br /><br />Leave at room temperature and they will turn white and become hard. They will then be drillable.<br /><br /><object width="425" height="344"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/PScjJxbZ7aI&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1"><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/PScjJxbZ7aI&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="425" height="344"></embed></object>
