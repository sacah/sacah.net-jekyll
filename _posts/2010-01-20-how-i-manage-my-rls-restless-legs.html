<strong style="font-weight: normal;"><a href="http://www.rls.org/">Restless Legs Syndrome</a> (RLS)</strong> is what my GP said I have, when I lay down to sleep at night I am hindered from actually getting to sleep for 2-4hrs by my legs building up a sensation and I have to move them to rid the sensation. Once moved the sensation will build again in a matter of seconds.<br />At times that I am tired of an evening and sitting down sometimes I will get the same sensation, but not very often.<br /><br />Here is my plan for going to bed:<br />Wait until I'm tired usually by doing an activity that requires minimal thought. I'll then have a shower just to stand under the water for a few minutes. Then I hope into bed and try to goto sleep, most times my legs, occasionally my elbows will get the sensation, I then get up and do some stretched of my legs and some jogging on the spot for a few minutes and go back to bed.<br />Sometimes I can get to sleep from here, and if it's not too late, or I'm not required to get up early the next day I repeat this process until I get to sleep.<br /><br />If I need to get up early the next day and require sleep, I'll take 2 nurofen tablets with 2 vitamin C tablets, not sure why, just 2 nurofen tablets work most times, but not always, taking it with vitamin C has given a much higher success rate.<br />I'll stand by the bench after I've taken the tablet and maybe eat a few crackers for a couple of minutes, then have another quick shower to stand under the water, then back to bed.<br /><br />Nurofen has a warning about not taking repeatable for more than a few days in a row, so I try and break up using this technique with the stretching and shower system in alternating nights. If after 45min-1hr I can't get to sleep I'll get up and make some toast, maybe watch 15min of TV, then back to bed to try again.<br /><br />Hope this helps others, let me know how you go.
