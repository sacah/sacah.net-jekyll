So I've been using afraid.org for my <b><a href="http://freedns.afraid.org/">free DNS</a></b> for about 3 years, and as part of making their service free others can request to have subdomains from your domain.<br />So if for some weird reason you want a sacah.net subdomain, head over to afraid.org for <a href="http://freedns.afraid.org/">dns for free</a>, signup and once you login click '<a href="http://freedns.afraid.org/domain/registry/">Registry</a>' in the left menu. Then search for sacah.net and request to add a subdomain, or look through the thousands of other domains on there and maybe you'll find one you like better (-:
