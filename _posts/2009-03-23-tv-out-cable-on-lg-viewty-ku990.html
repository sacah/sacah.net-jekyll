I was pretty excited about getting the TV Out Cable so I could watch the Cricket, which is currently not on free to air TV, but is on my 3 phone. After getting the cable and trying as I could I find out that you can only play videos back onto a TV via the inbuilt movie player. The streaming video player that the browser uses can't output to the TV.<br /><br />Big disappointment...
