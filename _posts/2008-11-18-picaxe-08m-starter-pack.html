After my attempts at using the HC08, I thought I'd try my hand at PICAXEs to get back into the swing of micro-controllers. I purchased the PICAXE 08M STARTER PACK from http://www.wiltronics.com.au/catalogue/shop.php?cid=177763 put it all together and hey presto this one actually works, unlike the HC08.<br /><br />If you try this starter kit, be sure to look at the assembly instructions at http://www.rev-ed.co.uk/picaxe/ click the Schools Experimenter picture to view a very helpful PDF for putting it together and your first program.<br /><br />I am finding that because the PICAXE is used in schools and by hobbyist there is a wealth of examples out there to learn from.<br /><br /><br />What was my problem with the HC08?<br />I bought it from a company in Australia, who I think had it sitting on shelf for many years as the software was out of date and didn't work downloading the examples to the demo board. So I downloaded the latest software and the example code for my HC8 didn't work with the new software, but the new examples didn't work with my HC08. So I was stuck without being able to get anything but 1 basic LED flashing example to work. Not having done this for a few years I'm left unsure if it's me just having forgotten something or if the demo board is faulty. Hopefully one day I'll have a logic analyzer and I'll might be able to find what's happening.
