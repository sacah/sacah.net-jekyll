Exactly 6 weeks after completing the tests I got my results. I passed the tests and my personality is inline with being a Student Paramedic.<br /><br />Next step is Medical Assessment and Health Related Fitness Assessment (HRFA). I have 60 days to complete both these.<br /><br />Medical Assessment contains 2 parts. Part 1 you fill out, asks about your medical history. Part 2 your local GP fills out.<br /><br />HRFA is all the excersises you can read about in the preperation PDF on the QAS website, and must be done through an approved provider. There are 2 such providers on the Gold Coast, so I guess I'll be giving them a call shortly.
