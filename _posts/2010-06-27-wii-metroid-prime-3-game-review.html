After hearing many wonderful reviews about this game, I started playing with anticipation. While the game was reasonable easy to pick up, I was quite often annoyed at the controls not going where I wanted them too, though I think this stems from my FPS experience on a PC. The Wiimote is great, but it's no match for a mouse in FPS IMO.<br /><br />The opening scenes of the game you use the Wiimote to push buttons and control levers, which is clever use of the Wiimote, but the panning using the Wiimote just annoyed me time and time again. Once you actually get into the game it's more like a standard FPS with only small parts utilising the Wiimotes capabilities.<br /><br />I was able to get around reasonably well, there were no hard to maneuver points where my character got stuck and no glitches that leave you feeling cheated. Though doors took a while to open at times and it was easy to get side tracked and have no idea where you were meant to be heading, both played on my nerves a few times leaving a sour undertone to my gaming experience.<br /><br />All in all I'm glad I rented it and didn't buy it, though when the price comes down I'll probably grab it and try it a second time.
