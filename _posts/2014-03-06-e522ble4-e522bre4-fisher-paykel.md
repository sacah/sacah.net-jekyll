Old fridge/freezer died, so we figured we'd get a larger one and hopefully not need our stand-alone freezer anymore. After extensive research I signed up to Choice.com.au to read about their fridge reviews, which listed this fridge with an overall score of 81, which is only 2 behind the best fridge, another F&amp;P RF522WDRX4.

The RF522WDRX4 was $700 something more expensive, and didn't really seem to offer anything better, so we settled on the E522BLE4 from Appliances Online.

~~~fold~~~

Appliances Online were great, the website was fast and easy to use, they told me how many were in stock and when delivery could be before I placed an order and offered free delivery and removal of my old fridge. We got through to the customer service almost immediately when we rang to organise delivery, and the delivery occurred 2days later in the middle of their per-arranged 2hr delivery window, by friendly staff. This place has certainly got their business in order.

Edit:

After owning it for a few weeks, it's a great fridge, not whisper quite, but it's in the kitchen, so it's acceptable to have a small amount of noise. Maintains its temperature well, below are some graphs I've taken.

I struggled to find many pictures of this model online, even the F&amp;P website shows pictures for a few models on the product page, so below I've included a bunch of pictures for other interested parties.
