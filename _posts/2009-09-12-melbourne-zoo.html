For only $24.50 for Adult entry this is an amazing experience. So much to see and do you'll need to set aside the better part of a day. There is a lot of ground to cover, so wear comfortable shoes, take some snacks and drinks in a bag with you, if you have little ones defiantly bring a stroller.<br /><br />A massive collection of widely different types of animals, presented in an adventure all the way around. They don't just show you the animals, all enclosures are designed and presented in the theme of the animals and this continuously changes as you travel around the zoo. An extremely well done experience I'd recommend to anyone.<br /><br />Only issue we had was trying to find the Zoo, it wasn't greatly signed.<br /><br />Photos to come...
