I ordered a few things from <a href="http://www.dealsdirect.com.au/">dealsdirect.com.au</a><br />Upon delivery one of the items was broken, I took a photo, followed the website prompts and within a few hours a customer service representative had replied with an apology and sent a new unit to me.<br /><br />Fantastic customer service. <br /><div class="ii gt" id=":zk"><wbr></wbr></div>
