After months of getting a few hours out of a battery, bought some cheap ones off eBay and it gave me the same time. I know the eBay batteries aren't as good as they advertise, I've tested these mobile batteries and some AA and AAA rechargeable and found the cheap eBay ones to be at times half what they are sold as. Back to the LG.<br /><br />While it's still under warranty, it would be away for a few weeks and I don't have a replacement phone to use. Plus I've spoken to a few other people who also have this phone, theirs has been back to get repaired a few times. While I liked the phone, they needed to do more work on the software, and they seem to have given up on it early on and moved onto supporting their newer phones, so I didn't see the point in sticking around with this one.<br /><br />After searching around I settled on a Samsung i900. I will never own an LG phone again.
