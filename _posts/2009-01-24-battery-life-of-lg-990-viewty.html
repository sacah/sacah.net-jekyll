When I first got this the Viewty I charged it up like they say and used it till nearly flat then charged it again. The phone would last maybe 3 days with a few calls and texts a day and short web browsing.<br />Then after about 3months of owning my phone, my cd player broke and I started using the phone to play music each night. The first night I played music it had a full battery when I went to bed, but died half way through the next day. So I started plugging it in to the charger each night while I played music. I'd notice if I made a few more calls than normal, or watched cricket on it the battery wouldn't last till that night.<br /><br />If these batteries didn't have any memory effects my charging it each night wouldn't have degraded the battery life to less than 6hrs.<br /><br />So I left it go flat one day, then every hour I'd try and turn it on, it would start to boot then run flat again. After about 6hrs of doing this to make sure it was completely drained I charged it fully.<br />Doing this I am able to:<br />Monday 0730 - Take phone off charger<br />Monday 2330 - Play music, 41 mp3s, at 2hrs 17min, lowest volume<br />Tuesday 1330 - Watch 30min cricket full screen full volume<br />Tuesday 2000 - Watch 45min cricket full screen half volume<br />Wednesday 0100 - Play music, 2hrs 17min, lowest volume<br />Wednesday 1000 - Play music, 1hr 30min, lowest volume - Battery died.<br /><br />would have been 20min of calls and 10sms in that time too.<br /><br />So every weekend maybe let your phone run dead, then charge it up overnight and it looks to last longer though the week.
