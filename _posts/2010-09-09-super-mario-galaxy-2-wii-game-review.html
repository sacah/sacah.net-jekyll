My first rented game from <a href="http://www.getgaming.com.au/">GetGaming Australia</a> was Super Mario Galaxy 2, I was quite eager to play it as all the reviews were quite positive.<br /><br />It was an impressive game, did an excellent job of the platform to 3D conversion that hasn't been done successfully many times before. The controls initially are fairly easy to get a handle on, there is lots of new skills to learn and things to collect and each level is well designed and thought out to keep increasing the difficulty.<br /><br />Played it for about 5hours before sending it back, like so many Wii games I just can't get a handle on the camera angle and at times you can't change it at all, which as levels got harder left me frustrated at falling off edges that I couldn't see coming because of the angle of the camera.<br /><br />As a casual gamer, and not having forked out $99 for this game, this was enough frustration to cause me to stop playing, and until it's on the bargain bin I won't be buying it.
