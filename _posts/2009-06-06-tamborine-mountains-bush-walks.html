Finally got around to visiting the <a href="http://www.rainforestskywalk.com.au/">Tamborine Rainforest Skywalk</a> today, it's privately owned, so you'll need to pay to get in, was $18.50 per adult when we went, at our slow pace it took us 28min, though the guides say it will take 40min normally, maybe different time of year there woul be more animals out to look at.<br />It was very nice, the skywalks were fun and anyone who can walk 2km over 40min-1hr could do this walk, it's very easy. There is also a cafe there where you can get food and drinks and sit outside looking over nature.<br />It was a good one off thing to do, if we had visitors it's something we'd take them too, but it's not really worth the $18.50 when, if your of moderate fitness, there are so many other government run national park walks where you will get much closer to the water/waterfalls.<br /><object width="560" height="340"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/9uVqDUdtFzU&hl=en&fs=1&"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/9uVqDUdtFzU&hl=en&fs=1&" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="560" height="340"></embed></object><br /><br />On our way back from the Skywalk we stopped to get some ice cream and found the <span style="font-size:100%;">Curtis Falls walk, which </span><span style="font-size:100%;">was only 1.2km return. This walk had some steps in it, but was pretty nice and easy. You got a lot closer to the water and a decent sized waterfall too compared to Skywalk, Curtis Falls is part of the Joalah section of Tamborine national park.<br /></span><object width="425" height="344"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/pAQhnT-idQA&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1&amp;"><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/pAQhnT-idQA&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1&amp;" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="425" height="344"></embed></object>  <a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_-gckRFXob4c/SipBVl-k8eI/AAAAAAAAAFQ/itwy6VtwfWk/s1600-h/curtis_falls.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 0pt 10px 10px; float: right; cursor: pointer; width: 150px; height: 200px;" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_-gckRFXob4c/SipBVl-k8eI/AAAAAAAAAFQ/itwy6VtwfWk/s200/curtis_falls.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5344155747056153058" border="0" /></a>
