Queensland doesn't have any restrictions on the power of lasers, but because some states do, the federal police have a 0.5mW limit on importing lasers.<br />To import one into Queensland:<br />1. Go to http://www.police.qld.gov.au/programs/weaponsLicensing/forms1.htm and download and fill in <span id="FCKeditorPlaceholder1"></span><a href="http://www.police.qld.gov.au/Resources/Internet/programs/weaponsLicensing/documents/ImportPermit.pdf">Application for an Import Permit</a><br />2. Send the permit back to the address at the top of form and wait for them to send you a permit.<br />3. Next go to http://www.customs.gov.au/site/page.cfm?u=4533 and download and  fill out the B710 Form, Application for permission to import Schedule 2 &amp; 3 weapons<br />4.&nbsp; Send it off to customs and wait for them to send back a letter oking the importing of your laser.<br />5. Once you have the letter, you'll need to send the letter to the Brisbane Airport, you'll need to ring them to find out the address. OR wait for your package to come, they will confiscate the item and send you a registered letter, in this registered letter will be the address to send it, and it tell you the max rated output of your laser, good info to have as most of us don't have a laser power tester handy.
