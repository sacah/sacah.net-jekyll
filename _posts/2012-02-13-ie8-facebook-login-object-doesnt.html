So doing some more work on Facebook integration, we were posting to facebook.com/dialog/oauth/ and when it redirected back all.js was throwing an error 'Object doesn't support this property or method' at this line response={authResponse:FB._authResponse,status:FB._userStatus};<br /><br />I couldn't find anywhere in all.js where it defined response, so a quick hack I added<br /><br /><pre>var response={};</pre><br /><br />This solved the issue for me, hope this helps. If you know anything more leave a comment.
