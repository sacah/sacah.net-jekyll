I have been interested in getting into small embedded devices for some time, and with my recent 3 weeks off over Christmas, I decided to have a squiz at what was around. I was initially hoping for something under $20-$30 to play with as I had heard PICs were cheap, in my searching I couldn't find a starter pack for under $80, I broadened my search and found a range of microcontroller starter packs(evaluation packs) for around the same price. I have had some experience with HC08s in a job when I was younger, so I decided to settle with one of these.<br /><a href="http://au.farnell.com/jsp/search/productdetail.jsp?SKU=4154320">http://au.farnell.com/jsp/search/productdetail.jsp?SKU=4154320</a><br /><br />The other good thing with one of these is I have a lot of room to grow into more powerful microcontrollers using the same development package, unlike what I had read about the PICs being under powered for anything real.<br /><div style="text-align: left;">I must say I did find, after already purchasing my HC08, PICAXEÂ® microcontrollers which were quite cheap and had a much simpler programming language, but after looking into them further, I would still have opted for the HC08.<br /><br />My first hurdle was getting the Metrowerks software to work, turns out the included CD was version 2.1 and their latest version was 6.1, way out of date, which was why I couldn't get the Registration process to work.<br />If you buy this product, you will receive the <a href="https://www.freescale.com/webapp/Download?colCode=CWX-HC08-SE&amp;nodeId=01272600610BF1&amp;location=overview&amp;WT_TYPE=IDE%20-%20Debug,%20Compile%20and%20Build%20Tools&amp;WT_VENDOR=FREESCALE&amp;WT_FILE_FORMAT=zip&amp;WT_ASSET=Downloads">Special Edition: CodeWarrior for Microcontrollers</a>, which restricts your code size to 32K, if you also have an old version included, download the new one from their Website, under Downloads - > Special Edition Software.<br />After some email support from Freescale, everything was licensed and I was ready to go.<br /><br />I will be sparotically posting my findings as I play with this microcontroller, so come back every now and then if your interested.<br /><span style="font-size:130%;"></span></div>
