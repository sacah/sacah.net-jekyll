Traveled to Roma Street ambulance station, Brisbane today for my final interview. The front door is locked, so you'll have to push the red button next to the door, and let them know who you are. Once they buzz you in you take the lift to the 2nd floor.<br /><br />I filled out the Criminal History check, got my photo taken and waited for the previous interview to finish. Once it was over, one of the recruitment people lead me out the back and I was given the questions they would be asking me. I was allowed 15minutes to read over these, and given space to write my response, or points to jog your memory during the interview.<br /><br />The responses are meant to be in the STAR format, which they will describe in the PDF sent to you a few weeks before your interview. Don't just give them an overview of the event in the STAR format, they want more details on areas of the story that will highlight your abilities in relation to being a Paramedic.<br /><br />Defiantly think about why you want to be a Paramedic, and what skills, abilities or personality traits you have that would benefit you as a Paramedic. Once you have a list of the skills, abilities or traits, think about circumstances where you used them in the STAR format.
