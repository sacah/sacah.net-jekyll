Received a phone call letting me know I passed the fitness and medical assessments, and once an interview time was available I would be contacted. I was quite surprised when 2 days later I got a phone call with an interview time, will be 3rd November, not far away at the Rome St Ambulance Station.<br /><br />Only thing I needed to do that I hadn't yet, was get a blood test to prove I had my hep B shots, I just sent the doctors letter in, but they want proof it worked I guess.
