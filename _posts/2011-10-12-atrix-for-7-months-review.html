So after 7 months using my Motorola Atrix I can say I still love this phone. Stock it has been capable of lasting a full 24hrs with Wifi, bluetooth and GPS active, and spending 14hrs in a quite low signal area.<br /><br />After a few months stock to make sure the hardware wasn't faulty, I rooted me device and have been able to tweak it to give me minimum two days battery life, though in times of light use it will stretch to just over 3 days.<br /><br />While I initially thought the Finger print scanner was a&nbsp;gimmick, after using it to unlock my phone for 7 months now I still love it, so quick and smooth while still being secure.<br /><br />As far as apps I've found that has really made the phone experience great:<br />GoLauncher, awesome home screen with App menu replacement.<br />GoSMS, SMS replacement that is amazing.<br />Folder Organizer, used to create easy to use folders on home screen.<br /><br />All the other apps I run are specific to my needs such as weather widgets, exchange rate widgets, firewall etc.<br /><br />So while the new Galaxy has been released, I'd still get this phone, it's smaller size let's it fit in my one hand easily for using, the Galaxy doesn't really offer anything extra in the way of performance that any apps are actually able to use.<br /><br />So I'd still recommend this phone to anyone looking for a new device.
