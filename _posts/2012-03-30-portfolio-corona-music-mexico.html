A music driven promotion website, launched down in Mexico recently. People can redeem vouchers from their Corona packages for credits that they can spend streaming or downloading music.<br /><br />The initial design and HTML/CSS were created by a 3rd party Mexican agency, as I added functionality to the pages and further changes came through, I ended up re-writting much of the CSS and many of the HTML pages to solve cross browser issues, polish the design and facilitate functionality.<br /><br />Most of the functionality is handled by Javascript, AJAXing to a BE which returns JSON. It features Music listings, creating/editing of playlists, sharing of artists and albums via Facebook, and the ability to stream 30sec and full length tracks via the Flash player.<br /><br />I had to make heavy customisations to the Flash player to support next track pre-caching, streaming token retrieval, add to playlist, and purchase/download buttons for currently playing song.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-XoAFk26WhfA/T3XdJLwt1iI/AAAAAAABNDg/lI5OeTrs8Bs/s1600/descargas2.coronamusic.com.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="337" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-XoAFk26WhfA/T3XdJLwt1iI/AAAAAAABNDg/lI5OeTrs8Bs/s640/descargas2.coronamusic.com.png" width="640" /></a></div><br />I also built the simple HTML/CSS for a feature phone version of this site, and assisted the BE developers in supporting these devices for streaming.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-s3hTpdNdR48/T3XdisZlwRI/AAAAAAABNDo/rp7VXJkwQ9I/s1600/m.coronamusic.com.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-s3hTpdNdR48/T3XdisZlwRI/AAAAAAABNDo/rp7VXJkwQ9I/s1600/m.coronamusic.com.png" /></a></div><br />You can see both these at descargas2.coronamusic.com and m.coronamusic.com
