I have been using my WL-600g for a few weeks now and like it, it's quite a feature packed modem once you upgrade it from v1 firmware to v3.<br />Few downsides from my old Billion 7300G:<br />1. WL-600g wireless signal isn't as strong.<br />2. With my ISP, and aparently other ISPs hardware, every 30 hours it will disconnect any report 'Authentication Failed', which will require a restart.<br /><br />It kind of sucks, I replaced my 7300G because it was randomly restarting, now I have a new model that requires random restarting...<br /><br />I might try OpenWrt on it and see if that fixes the problem.
