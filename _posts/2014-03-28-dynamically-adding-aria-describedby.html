Just a quick one to let others know what I've found, while it seems many of the ARIA tags work happily when added dynamically, aria-describedby will only work if it's present when the DOM is rendered, after that screen readers just won't see it.<br /><br />The simple ways around this seem to be adding random unique aria-describedbys to all your elements, then dynamically changing the ID of what you want to point too.<br /><br />Or use a global aria-live element that you change the text in to match the text you would have pointed to with aria-describedby.<br /><br /><br />
