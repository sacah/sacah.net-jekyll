Recently upgraded from a GTX 770 to 2 GTX 970s. One concern I had was keeping the heat down to get the best performance, and most threads you read about SLI tell you to get a blower style cooler, although these give worse cooling results by themselves. I looked at my motherboard and case and figured I had enough room and airflow to take the risk, so after reading a ton of reviews I opted for 2 Galax GTX 970 EX OCs.

~~~fold~~~

These are quite amazing cards, and an equally amazing price. I'd recommend you include these in your short list of which 970 to buy, check out all the in-depth reviews there are out there.

With both cards installed in my ASRock X99 motherboard, you can see there is a 2.5cm gap between the top and bottom card.

At the front of my case I have 2 120mm fans that pull air in and over the HDDs, this is to the right of the above picture.

At the rear, above the GPUs there is 1 120mm fan pulling air out the back of the case.

On the top of the case are 2 80mm fans pushing air in over a radiator that cools the CPU.

With the direction of the fins on the GPUs some air also makes it out the back of the graphics cards.

I also have my wifi PCIe card installed in the last panel, which blocks 25% of the left fan on the bottom card. These cards turn off the right fan at idle, so it's the left fan that is running at idle, so maybe once I can remove this wifi card the bottom card will get slightly better temps.

With this not great airflow I manage the following temps:

Load - (Unigine Heaven Benchmark - Extreme in Surround)

The side panel of my Corsair 400R case has room for 2 140mm fans that point right at the 2 GPUs, I'm awaiting some fan extension cables, then I'll try adding fans to the side and optimising the airflow of my case a bit better.

In a quick test I set one fan on the side to push air in, over the GPU and it lowered the temp by about 5&deg;C, so once I set this up properly, I think these cards should do very well.

## Overclocking

I was able to push both cards core +180mhz and mem +400mhz with a power boost of 120%, nice and stable. Pushing the core to +185mhz would cause issues. These figures seem pretty standard for what other Galax 970 EX OC cards are getting.
