Using the base of a Tripod, the bit that screws into most (video) cameras I glued some PCB, which had soldered 3 metal pins to another PCB with 6 IR LEDs, a 9v connector and some wires to a temporary switch. These were fairly cheap, low quality IR LEDs, so while the idea worked, it is not viable for objects more than 40-50cms away.<br /><br />I don't have a need for night shooting, so won't be putting any time into improving this, but using higher brightness and quality LEDs, and smaller ones to fit more onto same area will improve distance.<br /><br />Let me know if you build a better version.<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_-gckRFXob4c/STJr_9_r85I/AAAAAAAAADg/xSqf9z6E4os/s1600-h/tripod_mount_ir_leds.jpg"><img style="float:left; margin:0 10px 10px 0;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 134px; height: 200px;" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_-gckRFXob4c/STJr_9_r85I/AAAAAAAAADg/xSqf9z6E4os/s200/tripod_mount_ir_leds.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5274396860321887122" /></a>
