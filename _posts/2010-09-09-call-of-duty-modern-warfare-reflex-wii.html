I really don't like FPS on the Wii, though I haven't yet tried an on-the-rails on the Wii I think this is the only shooting kinds of game I'd like with it's limited controls.<br /><br />I started playing thinking it might be different, and 15minutes later the game was back in it's envelope ready to send back. Graphics were good, gameplay was good, everything was easy to pickup and understand, but the Wiimote just isn't a viable mouse alternative for my liking.<br /><br />Make sure you rent a FPS for the Wii before you buy one, you might be sorely disappointed.
