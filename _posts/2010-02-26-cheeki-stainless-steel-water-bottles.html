<div>I was looking for some stainless steel water bottles for my wife and I, so we can reuse them without risk of toxins leeching into our water. After looking around the countless online stores selling enourmous numbers of bottle designs and sizes, I settled on the <a href="http://www.shopnaturally.com.au/cheeki-750ml-metallic-purple-stainless-steel-water-bottle-with-screw-lid-sports-cap-optional-extra.html">750ml metalic purple</a> and <a href="http://www.shopnaturally.com.au/cheeki-750ml-gecko-stainless-steel-water-bottle-with-screw-lid-sports-cap-optional-extra.html">750ml green geko</a> one from <a href="http://www.shopnaturally.com.au/">Shop Naturally</a>.<br /><div class="image"><a href="http://www.shopnaturally.com.au/cheeki-750ml-metallic-purple-stainless-steel-water-bottle-with-screw-lid-sports-cap-optional-extra.html" imageanchor="1"><img alt="cheeki 750ml metallic purple" border="0" height="200" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_-gckRFXob4c/S4cvk-8G6DI/AAAAAAAAAKo/iwunhK_kBRE/s320/cheeki-700-purple.jpg" /></a></div><div class="image"><a href="http://www.shopnaturally.com.au/cheeki-750ml-gecko-stainless-steel-water-bottle-with-screw-lid-sports-cap-optional-extra.html" imageanchor="1"><img alt="cheeki 750ml geko" border="0" height="200" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_-gckRFXob4c/S4cvmVlnohI/AAAAAAAAAKw/nIlh91GW4l8/s320/cheeki-750-gecko.jpg" /></a></div><br /><br /><a name='more'></a>The <a href="http://www.shopnaturally.com.au/">Shop Naturally</a> site made it fairly easy to see the difference between them, and had a good price. The ordering process was easy and we soon got our water bottles. We ordered them just before Christmas when they were shut, so I can't comment on delivery speed of new orders.<br /><br />At the time of purchasing them, cheeki advertised them as freezable. So my wife had been putting hers in the freezer, half full and after a few weeks the bottom poped out, leaving it not standing flat anymore.</div><div>Shop Naturally said this would be covered under warrenty because when we bought it they were advertised as freezable, but that has since been removed, so we can't put the new one in the freezer.<br /><br />After the confirmed that it was damaged from freezing and not misuse, they sent us a new bottle next day delivery. So through my dealings with <a href="http://www.shopnaturally.com.au/">Shop Naturally</a> I'd say they have been excellent.</div>
