Road works have never been much of a problem for me in Toowoomba, when they stopped me from getting somewhere the town wasn't too big so I knew my way around pretty well. Since I have moved to the Gold Coast I am relaying on my GPS heavily when I go anywhere new. Because the Gold Coast is expanding so quickly new roads are being created and old ones are being reworked, lights, roundabouts and traffic islands are being added which can massively impact on your ability to get from Point A to Point B if your unaware of these changes, since most GPSs in Australia are using Sensis maps, they are quickly out of date and the GPS leads me down one way streets, tells me to turn right when there is now a traffic island preventing me from doing such, or takes me on roads that once lead to a location but now have been changed.<br /><br />While the GPS is great at recalculating an alternative route, the extra distance I travel to correct the mistake can sometimes be anywhere from 100m-10km. I was thinking about this from a Carbon Emission stand point, while fuel prices are going up and we are all trying to save the environment, it's cheaper for me to buy the little bit extra fuel and maybe donate to <a href="http://www.carbonneutral.com.au/">carbon neutral</a>, than to fork out $149.95AUD each time I need a map update, which at this rate could easily be every 3 months. While I'm not sure, I think Sensis use actual people to travel roads marking changes, hence why they charge the GPS companies for updates and this is then passed onto the consumer.<br /><br />Again I'm not sure but I think all road works now days is plotted by GPS before it is built, this means the local council, or construction company already has done the work, why can't Sensis put a system in place to accept these GPS coordinates from local council programatically, this could be all automated from Sensis's point of view, massively reducing costs, which they could pass onto GPS companies, thus passing onto us. With map updates being much cheaper, we can all get map updates and help reduce carbon emissions.<br /><br />I have a few conservative calculations I worked out below:<br />Cars average about 200grams of CO2 per km<br />At least 1,000,000 GPS units have been sold in Australia<br />If each of these people go somewhere new once a month, with one detour caused by out of date maps each time.<br />Average 4km extra travel per detour.<br /><br />1,000,000 * 4 * 12 * 200 / 1000 / 1000 = 4,800 metric tons of Carbon Emissions<br />Like taking 1,832 average cars off the road each year (average distance travelled is 14000km yearly)<br /><br />While this is a minuscule fraction of the 326,757,000 metric tons of CO2 we (Australia) emit each year, every bit helps.<br /><br />The more time that passes the more GPS units sold, and the high the number of un-mapped road changes for older GPS units who's maps have not been updated.
