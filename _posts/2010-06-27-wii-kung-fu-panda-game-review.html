This seemed like a fun game when we rented it, and it was marked as 2 players. Once the disc loaded up I tried to start the game and could only manage to get 1 player, back to the menu I went through and found a 2 player option was only under the Challenges, which were small side games.<br />These were interesting to kill an hour or so, but we quickly bored of them, and understandable as they are only side games.<br /><br />I enjoyed the main game, despite it being only 1 player, controls were easy to pick up and use, action was fairly constant and finding your direction was very easy to follow.<br /><br />I'd pay no more than $50 for this game though.
