So working on my local wampserver with some large MyQL databases I was often getting the MySQL has gone away message, and timed it to occur after 60seconds. I binged the message and got a number of suggestions to increase the timeouts and cache sized of MySQL, but this didn't help at all.<br />So I looked in the php.ini and found under the MySQL section there is a mysql.connect_timeout=60 I increased this to 600 and the problem went away.<br /><br /><br />Hope this helps others having this same issue.
