I had 4 garden solar lights laying around as every time I mow I pull  them out and never bother sticking them back in the ground.<br />I wanted something that would notify me when my plants needed  watering, when making the moisture sensors I thought I could just hook  them up to the LDR on the solar lights and everything would be sweet,  but when I cracked open the lights the clever Chinese hadnâ€™t used an  LDR, they had just directly used the solar panel, if power was coming in  turn lights off, power stops, turn lights on.<br />This was just as easy to tap into though, and in no time I had my  moisture sensor rigged up and working, now I just need to see if it  works in RL.
