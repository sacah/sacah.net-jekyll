Wireless setup was easy on Windows 7, connect the USB cable, run through the CD setup process, it picked up the wireless settings from my computer and automatically configured the printer, I pretty much just had to click Next.

Installing on a Vista laptop was a bit of a problem, it found it over the network but reported an error installing the MP files. Inserted the CD and ran through the same installation, minus the USB cable, at the end of the installation it again reported the MP file copy error, though the printer was installed and worked fine.

At a cost of $99 it's pretty good from the reviews I've read of other wireless printers, we even got 15% off and half price inks so we stocked up on black inks.

I really like having it in a central location, no where near a PC.
