While most things went smoothly for my upgrade to Windows 10, A-Tuning from ASRock would not start. There is no Windows 10 version for download, and the Windows 8.1 version wouldn't start. It would produce this error:

Error 0xFFFE "This utility is not for this platform"

~~~fold~~~

After some searching I couldn't find any answers, so I downloaded the Windows 7 version of A-Tuning and installed it in Compatability mode (Win 7), plus ran it in Win 7 compatability mode and it all runs fine now, controlling the fans is also working, so not sure why they can't release a Win 10 version.
