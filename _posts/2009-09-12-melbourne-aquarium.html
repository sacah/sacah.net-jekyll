After experiencing the Melbourne Zoo, this was a bit disappointing. Don't get me wrong, it is still an amazing experience with a collection of weird and wonderful marine life you probably haven't seen before and all the familiar favourites. For those who only have a few hours to fill, this is a great choice.<br /><br />The penguins here were much large than the penguins at the Melbourne Zoo, or the Antarctic centre in Christchurch - New Zealand, and they were very willing to show off for visitors darting around the water and leaping out.<br /><br />My other favourite were the jellyfish.<br /><br />If your going to both Aquarium and the Zoo, do the Aquarium first.<br /><br />Photos coming soon...
