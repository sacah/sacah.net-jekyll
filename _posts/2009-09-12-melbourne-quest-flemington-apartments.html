We got a 3 bedroom apartment at Quest Flemington in Melbourne for 5 days, it's positioned quite close to the city, Safeway and Coles, and a range of cafes and restaurants. The rooms are quite spacious, large Tv with 4 sports channels, and Discovery and FOX8. <br /><br />Main bedroom has king sized bed with ensuite and walk in robe. Other 2 rooms have 2 single beds in each with small cupboards. I'm pretty sure you can request a double or possibly queen bed in the other rooms.<br /><br />Very nice place to call home for any trips to Melbourne.<br /><br />Pics to come soon...
