Having played this game on my cousins Super Nintendo many moons ago, and reading a few reviews, I figured this would be a pretty safe game to buy for both of us to play. It's got quite a bit of single play value for casual gamers, and even my wife doesn't mind going back and doing previous levels trying to get the big coins from time to time.<br /><br />The game is as expected from previous games, though the game freezes for a split second when someone dies, which is really off putting if your character is half way through the air, or trying not to fall off a small post, while not often some maps you will feel cheated by your death because of the freeze.<br />I also found myself changing from standard Wiimote to nunchuck for different levels. For most the nunchuck addition makes it a lot more comfortable, though when vines are involved I went back to the Wiimote as I found myself pushing down or up as I was swinging side to side with the nunchuck joystick and falling off the vines!<br />And for the levels where you have to carry something, neither control option makes it comfortable.<br /><br />This has been the solid game we've played out of all we have, and well worth full price.
