I am greatly distressed at the disregard our society has for each other, the falling age of first time and serious offenders and the lack of respect for law enforcement and government. I would like to see the below plan, better thought out than my scratchings, implemented to Australia. I feel it would have a great impact on bringing a bit more discipline back into society.<br /><br />At Age 18, both Male and Female should be required to complete 12 months full time service in their choice of Army, Navy or Air Force. Or they can choose part time Community Service with a registered Organisation like Salvation Army, Lifeline etc. Community Service will require them to participate for a total of 261 days, a day defined by 8hrs of work, does not have to be continuous, over a period of upto 36 months. Eg. 3.5hrs four times a week for 150 weeks, giving 2 weeks off each year would get your time completed. This time will be logged by the Organisation they are volunteering with.<br /><br />Both will have a fine imposed for not completing your requirements without compelling reason.<br /><br />Entering the Military will see you placed at a post closest to your family and with room available, with full accommodation, meals and military attire provided. Along with a wage, like $15,000pa.<br />Allow recruits to start training in a trade or qualification, after the 12 months is completed a number of permanent positions are opened, based on recruitment needs in the military. Those who don't apply for, or are not accepted for a permanent position will be free to leave and either assisted to find an employer who will take on the remaining 3 years of their trade apprenticeship or work were ever they please. All will be given the opportunity to remain in Reserves.<br /><br />Community Service optees will receive an hourly rate, something like $6/hr, as they can continue to work part time/full time. During this time they can opt to study a range of subjects that apply themselves to the line of Community Service Organisation they have opted to work in. Things like<span style="font-size:85%;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"> </span></span>like Counselling (Legal, Financial, Marriage, Family, Mental Health etc), Carers (Basic Medical, Food preparation etc), Psychology, Welfare, Training etc. This would be largely on the job/hands on training, Cert III or IV courses that can be completed satisfactorily within 2088hrs. Once they have completed the 2088hrs required, they can be assisted to finding an employer who will continue their training and employment, or they can continue studying and find their own work to finance their further studies.<span style="font-size:85%;"><br /></span><pre><br /></pre>In both Military and Community Service participants will learn skills/trades, discipline, compassion, team work and a sense of community, hopefully we can instil a common goal and greater good mentality as they will be the next to lead our great country.<br /><br />Links<br /><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_service">List of <span class="toctext">Countries with/without mandatory military service</span></a>
