My current internal drives are getting a bit old and had me worried about loosing data, so I started looking around for a 1TB external drive, Aldi had a Medion for $87 but my local store didn't get any, Good Guys had an Imation one for $97 and Clive Anthony had this Seagate one for $99. I feel a bit more trusting of Seagate and when it's only $2 separating my decision was to got for the Seagate one.<br /><br />Once I got it home and opened it up I was pleasantly surprised that it came with power adapters for Australia, USA, UK and Asia, while these adapters aren't expensive it's a nice bonus to get.<br /><br />The drive itself is nice shiny black, perfect for fingerprints. Very quite apart from a little squeak when it spins up from sleeping, pre-formatted NTFS gives 931 real gb.
