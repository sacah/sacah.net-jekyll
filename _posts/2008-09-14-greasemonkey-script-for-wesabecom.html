Edit: With Wesabes updated interface this script no longer works.<br /><br />For those who don't know, <a href="http://www.wesabe.com">Wesabe</a> is an online basic financial management tool, takes direct exports from most banks and lets you apply tags, which can be used to track Earnings vs Spendings and help you budget. It is also a community when you can talk with others and provide tips about certain places you shop, which can then be seen by others who shop at the same place as you. These tips seem mostly USA based, but it's a good idea.<br /><br />With Tagging, you can give multiple tags to a certain transaction, and assign certain amounts to each tag, so say a $220 transaction was logged, you could tag Food with $100 and Clothing with $120, must have been my Wifes shopping day.<br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_-gckRFXob4c/SMyzOu6QWUI/AAAAAAAAACo/NvaTV16Zpqk/s1600-h/wesabe_splitSum_without.jpg"><img style="cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_-gckRFXob4c/SMyzOu6QWUI/AAAAAAAAACo/NvaTV16Zpqk/s200/wesabe_splitSum_without.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5245764731671697730" /></a><br /><br />While this is simple, I found when I budgeted I'd move a large amount of money around, which related to many tags, and as I typed them in I had to keep adding each one to a running total to make sure it matches the total amount in the end. So I created this Greasemonkey script to do it for me, now it adds a little box next to each one with a running total of all your tagged amounts.<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_-gckRFXob4c/SMyzOslzJbI/AAAAAAAAACw/DWdMf6lkBlE/s1600-h/wesabe_splitSum_with.jpg"><img style="cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_-gckRFXob4c/SMyzOslzJbI/AAAAAAAAACw/DWdMf6lkBlE/s200/wesabe_splitSum_with.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5245764731049026994" /></a><br /><br />Download Script: <a href="http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/33701">http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/33701</a>
