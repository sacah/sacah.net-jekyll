I completed the fitness test today, got 39/100. A pass is 24/100 so thankfully I passed, apparently my only thing left is an interview before I know if I've been accepted for the 6 week trial.<br /><br />I did the fitness test with Nathan Reeves, cost $80. Dexterity tests weren't a problem, ones I failed were flexibility. Ones I could have done better in were situps and aerobic fitness heart rate. So make sure you do all the excersises they list in the Student Paramedic PDF, they will really help you perform well.&nbsp;<br />Make sure you do some jogging on the spot too, work upto maybe 10min. This should help you in the aerobic heart rate test.<br /><br />Also, keep in mind when you're doing the situps that you need to keep your feet flat on the ground, if you lift them off the ground they will fail you for that test.
