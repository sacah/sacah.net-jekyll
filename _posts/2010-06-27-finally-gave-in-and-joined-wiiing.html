I've been a long time PC gamer, apart from an Atari 2600 and a GameGear I've shyed away from consoles as for overall bang for your buck I don't think they can hold their own compared to PCs. Once I got married my gaming time was sharply reduced, so I tried to get my wife interested in gaming, but to no avail. <br /><br />So as they came down in price, I thought it might be a good way to get her into gaming too. I had a look around at the different consoles and their offerings, Wii seemed to come out infront for casual gaming and had the ability to use custom written applications through HomeBrew so that's the one we chose.<br /><br />As many people have said previously, once you buy the Wii it seems you have a never ending list of accessories you need to buy, and find somewhere to store them!<br /><br />We've bought a few accessories from eBay, like classic controllers, Active exercise leg straps and tension strapsand these have been great and cheap so look there first, just as always read sellers feedback first and make sure the quality is on par with what you're after.<br /><br />Regarding HomeBrew, make sure you try the games, there are some amazingly addictive games on the list to download.
