Not a bad unit, after the motherboard in my PC connected to my TV died. Given the PC was quite old, I'd have to replace MB and CPU, so I figured I'd try the Macron.<br /><br />Has 2 USB, 1 memory card(SD,MMC,MS) inputs, standard RCA Video &amp; LR audio plus VGA outputs. Plug a HDD in and it will load up its contents.<br /><br />I like the interface, fairly basic scroll through, see titles and folders. Get a preview of video while scrolling through files. Supports <span id="ctl00_contentContainerHolder_PrdDescription">Supports MPEG4, MPEG2, MPEG1, AVI, DivX, XviD, WMV, RM, RMVB, VOB, DAT,    MP3, JPEG, BMP and GIF. </span>Played a 1.4gb DivX file no problem.
