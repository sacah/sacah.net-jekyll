While I really like blogger for general blogs, there are a number of features I wanted for my travel posts. My first thoughts were to write my own, but knowing how much stuff there is on the internet I had a squiz first.<br />I found <a href="http://travelpod.com/">travelpod.com</a>, which isn't flexible in the slightest, but pretty much does what I want. I'm slowly moving all my travel posts from blogger to <a href="http://www.travelpod.com/travel-blog/sacah/1/tpod.html">travelpod</a>.<br /><br />So if you want to check out <a href="http://www.travelpod.com/travel-blog/sacah/1/tpod.html">sacah travels</a>, head on over.<br /><br />The main thing I'd love to see with travelpod is the ability to customise it a bit, though I think a real strength of it is by structuring everything it's easy to cross navigate without layout changing. As I post more I'll get a better handle on everything and see what I think then.
