For our upcoming holiday we figured it was time to buy a digital video camera. After looking around I settles on a HDD version, and based on price and features settled on the JVC MG330. Got this from <a href="http://www.teds.com.au/">Ted's Cameras</a> for $599AUD which included a JVC Camera bag and a second standard BN-VF808J battery.<br /><br />As this is the first dedicated video camera I had owned I can't give an expert opinion, but my first impressions I am quite satisfied with it. Very easy to use, I like the laser touch idea to keep greasy mits off the screen. I have a <span style="font-style:italic;">(un)</span>natural shake in my hands, so was a bit worried about it not having an Optical Image Stabiliser, but the digital stabiliser does a good job at optical zoom levels, which is 35x. <br /><br />Feel free to ask any questions about this camera, I'll answer what I can to help anyone interested in it.
