The assessment is conducted by a 3rd party, called Living Stones. When you make a booking write down the time of your test, as it will not be sent to you in any receipts. If you ring up you will also not be able to find any information out about your test, time or location. 1 week before your assessment date you should get an email letting you know where and when, though the first email I got gave me wrong times. A few hours later a new email came in with the right location and start time, though the second assessment and finish times were still incorrect. If you have not received the email 5 days before your assessment, ring Living Stones and pressure them to check your email address is correct, they might try to brush you off saying they will get 'x' branch to send you another one, but make sure they check your address is correct first.<br /><br />Once you turn up, it's a standard set of assessments, I'm of average intelligence and was only unable to answer 5-6 questions out of the first 2 timed tests. The next 2 are untimed and I had no problems with them either finishing well before most others, even with double checking. Remember it's not a race and finishing first doesn't give you any extra points. Some people I took the assessment with said they had been studying for a week leading up to the assessment and they were unable to complete half of the timed assessments and took considerably longer than me to complete untimed ones, so I'm sure brushing up on math skills might help, but don't overdo it, didn't seem to do them any good.<br /><br />They let you know they will give the results to the QAS within 4 weeks. Will see how fast it goes from here. From what I can tell, next it's the Medical then fitness, but I'll have to wait until I pass this assessment before they reveal the secret of the next recruitment step (-;
