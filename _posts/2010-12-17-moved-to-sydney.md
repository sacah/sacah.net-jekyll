So, I love Javascript, out of all the languages I know, it's the most fun, the loosest and most rapidly changing one in existence. Though on the Gold Coast/Brisbane there are very few companies large enough to hire a specialist front end/javascript person, so I have to be a jack of all trades and cover everything from SEO to Graphics Design, Server maintenance to back/front end building, help desk and sales all rolled into each and every day.

Given I wanted to focus on Javascript I looked around and Sydney was the place with the most jobs specialising in Javascript, so I applied, got one and moved down.

Took us a few months, but now my wife and I have finally settled in Sydney and my new job. I currently have a 5month contract with Bupa, who own MBF, HBA and MC and do health, car, house, boat, caravan, life etc insurance. I've part of an awesome front end team who are transforming the three sites into a common system and revamping to bring closer to today's web application look and feel.

Very heavy dependencies on jQuery, though still some room to develop my own components and scripts so it's quite enjoyable breaking out of frameworks for a change and doing raw Javascript.

As we're in a new area there is so much to explore within a few hours from here, so my travel blog should get a work out, and as the money is fantastic hopefully it will allow us to travel some more outside Australia. Keep an eye on my travel blog for more on our adventures.
