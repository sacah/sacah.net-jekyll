Compiled diary I kept while on holidays over Christmas and New Year.<br /><br /><span style="font-size: 130%;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">22/12/08 - Arrival</span></span><br />The Air port is much smaller than I expected, though has a very much island feel, surrounded by palm trees and green mountains. There is also a local band playing to greet us, keeps us entertained in the queue through customs.<br /><object height="295" width="480"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/JXNkVZ4rDaY&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1"><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/JXNkVZ4rDaY&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="480" height="295"></embed></object><br /><br />I have intolerances to many foods, so I had asked customs before leaving what food I could bring into the country, and was told and commercially packaged plant products are fine, and any commercially packages animal products should be alright, but may require a permit. Once we got to customs and I opened my suitcase they seems un-concerned with what I had brought and kept asking if I had any Honey or Cheese, both things I can't eat so I kept letting them know no. Once they were happy I didn't have Honey or Cheese they wished us a happy Christmas.<br /><br />Once outside we were ushered into a Taxi which took us to our hotel in Port Vila, about 15min away. It is meant to be a set fee of 1,000vatu for a taxi from Airport to Port Vila, I didn't know this and was charged 1,800vatu for the ride. On the drive into town you'll experience some culture shock as most locals in Port Vila are fairly poor, outside of the city many natives still live traditionally.<br />This is not what many expect from and island paradise the brochures and ads show us.<br /><br />Once we got to the Olympic Hotel where we'd be staying it was basic, but for the price I considered it very reasonable accommodation. It doesn't have a pool, and there is no actually beach to swim at near by. But it is pretty much in the center or Port Vila so perfect as a central hub for exploring the city and day trips.<br /><br />I had seen other accommodation for 3-4 times the price which looks much nicer, but once we got there and saw some of these places, many didn't have beaches either, they just had a jetty going out into the ocean for you to get in/out. They were also surrounded by little shanty villages, and many were not air conditioned. I'd take an air conditioner over a pool any day so I am very happy we choose the Olympic Hotel.<br /><br />To swim you can walk up the main road toward the Sebel hotel, just past it there is a small semi sandy beach. Driving 15 minutes up or down from Port Vila will also get you to beaches, or taking a 4min ferry ride to Iririki Island and you'll have somewhere to snorkel and a small beach to swim at.<br /><br />There are many accommodation options you could look at 15+min outside Port Vila which have pools and sandy beaches, just be aware of travel to get into Port Vila to either do day trips or shop.<br /><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 130%;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">23/12/08</span></span><br />The ferry to Iririki Island is 1,500vatu pp, this enables you to got to and from the island as many times as you'd like for a 24hr period, the ferry runs 24hrs a day. Plus you can order a meal at the cafe on the island and the 1,500vatu will be deducted from your bill.<br /><object height="295" width="480"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/QC77zmYjMUg&hl=en&fs=1"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/QC77zmYjMUg&hl=en&fs=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="480" height="295"></embed></object><br /><br /><br />For exchanging money, I found Goodies had the best rates on AUD. While there is an ANZ branch here, with ANZ ATMs, you'll be charged a $5AUD cirrus atm transaction fee, and about 3% overseas transaction fee. Plus ANZ give you a poorer conversion rate. Goodies offered 75.85 on the 23rd of Dec, ANZ offered 74.66 on the same day.<br /><br />After looking around the Fruit markets, there isn't a wide variety of products, but there is a massive variety of quality and price, so shop around before purchasing something. And watch out when cruise ships come in, prices everywhere seem to go up.<br /><br />Look to buy disposable underwater cameras before you leave, they were 2,000vatu, about $28AUD, in Coles here they are $15AUD. Insect repellent aerosols can be taken on a plane as long as they have a lid and aren't in your carry on luggage, so buy these before you go away too. Aeroguard 250g was 1,190vatu.<br /><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 130%;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">24/12/08</span></span><br />The wireless internet is free with the Accommodation, most places offered this free. Google have a .vu so looking for local companies and websites is quite fast, on downloads outside Vanuatu I'm getting around 20kbytes/s. Though it does frequently drop out, upto 30seconds at a time so VOIP is unusable and make sure you either download everything you'll need while your over there and get a download manager that can handle resuming broken downloads.<br /><br />Make sure your mobile is not locked before you come, Digicel is the local mobile network and have great rates on calls to Austrlaia, for 2,000vatu I bought a pre-paid sim with 1,000vatu credit and a bonus 500vatu recharge card. Calls to Australian are about 40vatu/min.<br />From out hotel calls to Australia were 292vatu/min.<br /><object height="344" width="425"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/XhbKgPFVny4&hl=en&fs=1"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/XhbKgPFVny4&hl=en&fs=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="425" height="344"></embed></object><br /><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 130%;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">25/12/08</span></span><br />Iririki Island was very nice, went snorkelling and swimming on the beach and hired a kayak and went around the island. Kayaks can be hired for 1,500vatu/hr, and you can easily get around the island in 1hr. Snorkelling gear is 1,000vatu to hire for the day I think.<br />We saw quite a few fish snorkelling here, enough to spend a few hours easily. Be careful the walkway into the water is slippery.<br /><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_-gckRFXob4c/SWVOTSHw6iI/AAAAAAAAAEI/qdZY9jjhrRs/s1600-h/iririki_snoreklers.jpg" onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}"><img alt="" border="0" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5288719430605400610" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_-gckRFXob4c/SWVOTSHw6iI/AAAAAAAAAEI/qdZY9jjhrRs/s200/iririki_snoreklers.jpg" style="cursor: pointer; float: left; height: 150px; margin: 0pt 5px 5px 0pt; width: 200px;" /></a><br /><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_-gckRFXob4c/SWVOTIPtD5I/AAAAAAAAAEA/pCQNtb-Ajos/s1600-h/iririki_island.jpg" onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}"><img alt="" border="0" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5288719427954347922" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_-gckRFXob4c/SWVOTIPtD5I/AAAAAAAAAEA/pCQNtb-Ajos/s200/iririki_island.jpg" style="cursor: pointer; float: left; height: 93px; margin: 0pt 5px 5px 0pt; width: 200px;" /></a><br /><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_-gckRFXob4c/SWVOS3R7hWI/AAAAAAAAAD4/C9Zbhx2KOig/s1600-h/iririki_beach.jpg" onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}"><img alt="" border="0" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5288719423400281442" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_-gckRFXob4c/SWVOS3R7hWI/AAAAAAAAAD4/C9Zbhx2KOig/s200/iririki_beach.jpg" style="cursor: pointer; float: left; height: 150px; margin: 0pt 5px 5px 0pt; width: 200px;" /></a><br /><div style="clear: both;"></div><br /><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 130%;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">26/12/08</span></span><br />Went back to Iririki Island, snorkelled some more.<br /><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 130%;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">27/12/08</span></span><br />Went to Hideaway Island on a day trip booked through Adventures in Paradise. Cost 3950vatu pp. A normal bus picked us up at about 9am and a 15min ride took us to the Hideaway Island ferry. Entry to the island is 1,000vatu, included in the day trip price, though children under a certain age are free. As part of the day trip we get a free welcome drink, which is either orange or pineapple juice, which would have been 200vatu pp. Note I think this is just Golden Circle juice, but still nice when sipped from this gorgeous location.<br />Lunch was also included, a choice of 5-6 different burgers and wraps with chips, would have been 875vatu pp.<br />Included was also a 45min glass bottom boat tour and a 45min snorkelling tour.<br /><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_-gckRFXob4c/SWVQxwHqYpI/AAAAAAAAAEg/Pr8vikIqbAA/s1600-h/hideaway_snorkel.jpg" onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}"><img alt="" border="0" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5288722153077367442" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_-gckRFXob4c/SWVQxwHqYpI/AAAAAAAAAEg/Pr8vikIqbAA/s200/hideaway_snorkel.jpg" style="cursor: pointer; float: left; height: 150px; margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; width: 200px;" /></a><br /><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_-gckRFXob4c/SWVQxrfInII/AAAAAAAAAEY/r5qCtN6mFew/s1600-h/hideaway_postoffice.jpg" onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}"><img alt="" border="0" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5288722151833640066" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_-gckRFXob4c/SWVQxrfInII/AAAAAAAAAEY/r5qCtN6mFew/s200/hideaway_postoffice.jpg" style="cursor: pointer; float: left; height: 200px; margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; width: 150px;" /></a><br /><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_-gckRFXob4c/SWVQxaHOQrI/AAAAAAAAAEQ/afV2VDW_C5I/s1600-h/hideaway_island.jpg" onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}"><img alt="" border="0" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5288722147169944242" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_-gckRFXob4c/SWVQxaHOQrI/AAAAAAAAAEQ/afV2VDW_C5I/s200/hideaway_island.jpg" style="cursor: pointer; float: left; height: 150px; margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; width: 200px;" /></a><br /><div style="clear: both;"></div><br /><br />This is also where you can post your underwater post cards, these can be bought in Port Vila before you come, or buy them on the island, just remember to bring the addresses of people you want to send them too.<br /><br />Non-confident swimmers could spend 2-3hrs snorkelling around, confident swimmers could spend all day. The beach is shells and dead coral so reef shoes are recommended so you don't hurt your feet.<br /><br />If your happy snorkelling you don't really need to do the glass bottom boat tour, and if your a confident swimmer you can swim out to where the snorkelling tour takes you and see the same fish, only difference is the guide feeds the fish, so you see a larger cluster of fish than if you were by yourself. On the tour though there are lots of people all trying to see the same fish, so it's pretty crowded and you'll get kicked a few times.<br /><br />Disposable underwater cameras were 2,700vatu on Hideaway island, and defiantly buy them before coming.<br /><br />You can take any bags you have to reception while your at the beach or on tours and they will keep them for you, though it's pretty safe to leave things sitting on a chair on the beach, just don't leave cameras obviously exposed.<br /><br /><span style="font-size: 130%;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">28/12/08</span></span><br />Went to Mele Village and Waterfall. We choose option 3 from http://www.evergreen.com.vu/melecascades.html it was 8,100vatu for both of us. We were picked up in an air-conditioned bus and taken around the Mele Village, which is a great way to see how many Port Vila locals live. Then we drove a little further up the road to the Cascades.<br />There are dry places to leave your things so take your cameras, while you do walk through streams no-one fell over on our tour, so your camera should be fine.<br /><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_-gckRFXob4c/SWVSLnqbfoI/AAAAAAAAAFA/ySYuJ8ENr0I/s1600-h/mele_cascades3.jpg" onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}"><img alt="" border="0" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5288723696995499650" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_-gckRFXob4c/SWVSLnqbfoI/AAAAAAAAAFA/ySYuJ8ENr0I/s200/mele_cascades3.jpg" style="cursor: pointer; float: left; height: 200px; margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; width: 150px;" /></a><br /><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_-gckRFXob4c/SWVSLb_X5aI/AAAAAAAAAE4/rvKAcrk466E/s1600-h/mele_cascades2.jpg" onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}"><img alt="" border="0" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5288723693862118818" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_-gckRFXob4c/SWVSLb_X5aI/AAAAAAAAAE4/rvKAcrk466E/s200/mele_cascades2.jpg" style="cursor: pointer; float: left; height: 200px; margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; width: 150px;" /></a><br /><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_-gckRFXob4c/SWVSLH64MlI/AAAAAAAAAEw/Ky2ulqo4Iwk/s1600-h/mele_cascades.jpg" onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}"><img alt="" border="0" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5288723688474554962" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_-gckRFXob4c/SWVSLH64MlI/AAAAAAAAAEw/Ky2ulqo4Iwk/s200/mele_cascades.jpg" style="cursor: pointer; float: left; height: 150px; margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; width: 200px;" /></a><br /><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_-gckRFXob4c/SWVSK-_4fcI/AAAAAAAAAEo/kpBSNtiCyFE/s1600-h/mele_village.jpg" onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}"><img alt="" border="0" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5288723686079626690" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_-gckRFXob4c/SWVSK-_4fcI/AAAAAAAAAEo/kpBSNtiCyFE/s200/mele_village.jpg" style="cursor: pointer; float: left; height: 162px; margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; width: 200px;" /></a><br /><div style="clear: both;"></div><br /><br />After swimming for a while we came back down and had a great lunch, steak, 2 sausages, coleslaw, cucumber, tomato and lots of beautiful bread.<br />I think it's defiantly worth doing this tour rather than going by yourself, a bus up there would be 300vatu one way, it's 1,500vatu entry to the Cascades.<br />Our guide also shows us some interesting facts about the locals and we got to meet his dog who fetches coconuts. The guided tour through Mele Village isn't something you could do on your own either.<br /><br /><span style="font-size: 130%;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">29/12/08</span></span><br />Went to Cascades with Eco-tours, this and the Mele Cascades are by far my favourite tours. It was 4,900vatu each. You get picked up by a truck, which has been fitted out so you can sit on cushions in the back, really adds to the experience.<br />They provide you reef shoes if you don't have any also. We were picked up at 8:10 and dropped off at 12:15, well worth the time up there as the cascades and canyon tour was amazing.<br /><br />The guide was great on the canyon walk, he took things slow and stopped to inform everyone of each slippery bit so no-one got hurt.<br /><br />Fruit and juice are provided, there are dry spots to leave your cameras ad many opportunities to use them, if they are waterproof you can take them on te canyon walk also.<br /><br /><span style="font-size: 130%;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">30/12/08</span></span><br />We were going to go on a half day sail and snorkel, but when we arrived at the boat we were informed it had been cancelled. We got a refund from Adventures in Paradise and went down the road to South Pacific Cruises, we decided to do their 'Coongoola' Day cruise which left immediately. It costs 8.900vatu each, which is by far the most expensive sail/snorkel tour, and in my mind way over priced.<br /><br />After an hour bumpy bus ride we arrived at a small beach and were taken aboard. There were 50 people plus crew squeezed onto this boat. The back had a cover to provide shade but wasn't big enough for everyone to fit under it, so 10+ people had to either sit in the sun the whole time or stand flattened against the side of the cabin to get some shade. There would have easily been 2.5-3hrs of standing and having to pick up our bags and let others squise past us when they needed to move to the front where the toilet is.<br /><br />We visited a turtle farm, where they have small turtles in small tanks. They breed them and release them after 8months I think.<br />Then back on the boat and another 30min around the island and onto the beach, this was an amazing spot that came close to making up for the rest of the trip, though I think I would have found just as beautiful beach on the other sail tours that were 1,700vatu cheaper.<br /><br />On this beach we snorkelled for an hour, had a wonderful lunch and snorkelled for another 1.5hrs, then had to load up back on the boat. Your camera shouldn't get wet on this tour provided you are a bit careful.<br /><br />I would consider doing another tour that is cheaper and closer so less time is spent on a bumpy slow non-air conditioned bus ride.<br /><br /><span style="font-size: 130%;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">31/12/08</span></span><br />We were meant to go Sea Kayaking today, but my arms were saw from holding my bags and standing for 3+hrs yesterday, and being in a kayak on the ocean from 10am to 2pm seemed like a really hot part of the day and a great chance to get sun burnt. So we cancelled. We should have booked the River kayaking with Eco-tours instead, it seemed to be more shaded.<br /><br />Make sure you try kayaking first before booking a 4hr long tour where all you do is kayak.<br /><br />When you buy an ice cream, always grab one toward the bottom and give it a gentle squeeze to make sure the freezer is working and it's not melted. If you open it and find it's been melted and re-frozen go back and any shop should gladly give you a refund.<br /><br />Shop around in some of the back streets before buying anything, Vanuatu doesn't make many things other than the wood calving. The locals resell traditional looking clothing at rather expensive prices, this clothing is often imported from India or China. There are a lot of chinese shops, which you can somethings get cheap clothing, but shop around.
