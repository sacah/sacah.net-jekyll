Another holiday I organised, ski trip for 5 people to Methven, New Zealand. Skiing at Mt Hutt.<br /><br />30-08-09<br />Landed in Christchurch and asked the Vodafone dealer about a Vodafone sim, these are $30 without credit, and it's not a hire arrangement either, so you can't get the $30 back if you return the sim at the end of your holiday.<br /><br />Local calls from payphones are $1 and local calls from our hotel was $0.80 though no one we asked was able to give us a solid answer as to how much the local call would be from the hotel phone.<br />I think it's worth checking on your local mobile providers roaming rates and if your cap can be used toward global roaming.<br /><br /><a name='more'></a><br /><br />We got our hire cars and had some fun getting out of Christchurch, there aren't many roads going between towns, and the free tourist maps you pick up everywhere are sufficient, but in the cities there isn't a free map that helps. I'd recommend printing out route maps of the cities your going through before you go, or getting one of the NZ maps from your hire car dealer or a service station. You get one with Campervans usually, but not hire cars.<br /><br />31-08-09<br />Went to Big Als and got fitted with skis and clothes. After strapping it all down on our car roofs we headed up Mt Hutt, once we hit snow we pulled over to put our chains on, just as we got out of the car a wave of high winds came across the road and blew sharp bits of ice and snow at us, was just bad luck.<br />As we poped the boot to get our chains out we found our car hire company had cable tied the snow chains together and without pliers or something to cut the cable ties were stuck.<br />We had to back track down the hill to a snow chain fitting bay and the guy there had some pliers we could borrow, make sure you check your snow chains before leaving the hire company.<br /><br />We then continued up the rest of the hill and figured we'd pull into the car park just before the snow we'd hit before, this would give us shelter while we put the chains on, unfortunately at that point the car I was driving stalled. These were autos so it seemed strange, I tried to start the car again but it wouldn't turn over. After letting it sit and trying again I noticed the temp gauge shoot to 120oC when I turned the key, so we popped the bonnet.<br />While it sounds like an easy task, we couldn't for the life of us figure out how to pop the bonnet, we even resorted to reading the manual, eventually coming across the instructions that the FORD emblem on the front of the car actually moved, and once you rotate it up a key hole is revealed. Using the car key unlocks it and up it went.<br /><br />A burning smell was pretty strong, we checked the coolant fluid and saw it was empty, we had water in the car and put 2L in and waited as it bubbled hoping it was making it's way into the radiator and cooling it down., and tried to turn the car over again to get the water pumping through. We tried turning the car over again after 15min but still no luck, though the temp had gone down to half way now which was good. We ended up putting 6L into it, and after a few goes of turning over the car noticed water was dripping out the bottom, there appeared to be a hole in the coolant pipe.<br /><br />One of the great staff from Mt Hutt came down and used his 4WD to push us out of the middle of the road and into the car pack where we left the car for the tow truck to come pick it up.<br /><div class="image"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_-gckRFXob4c/SzYFgQrDPiI/AAAAAAAAAHY/KUuJw2C4GJs/s1600-h/blogski2.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_-gckRFXob4c/SzYFgQrDPiI/AAAAAAAAAHY/KUuJw2C4GJs/s320/blogski2.jpg" width="200" /></a><br /><div>Getting a Push</div></div><br />Now we were finally at the top it was pretty cool, and we figured we'd give skiing a go, none of us had tried before. I put my ski boots on and went to put my boot into the ski and the toe stop on the ski broke off, I tried to put it on but the force of putting my boot into the ski kept braking it off.<br />The guy at the ski shop checked it and it worked, so make sure you try putting your boots on and locking them into you skis before going up the hill so you can get the fixed. I'd had a whole day of skiing lost because of the broken car and the broken ski, not my best day!<br /><div class="image"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_-gckRFXob4c/SzYFl8MVWhI/AAAAAAAAAHg/J81ULyuqHCA/s1600-h/blogski1.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_-gckRFXob4c/SzYFl8MVWhI/AAAAAAAAAHg/J81ULyuqHCA/s320/blogski1.jpg" width="150" /></a><br /><div>Try skis on in hotel first!</div></div><br />01-09-09<br />Britz had delivered a new car that night to the local mechanic, he told us the engine was seized when it over heated. We checked the weather report for Mt Hutt and found it was closed till 9:30 so we had a look around Methven and rechecked the weather report at 9:30, which said it was closed till 10:30. Instead of continually checking a weather report we decided to go down to Lake Tekapo and the Church of the Good Shepherd.<br /><div class="image"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_-gckRFXob4c/SzYFrtF2oOI/AAAAAAAAAHo/BhsdjnczTwI/s1600-h/blogski3.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_-gckRFXob4c/SzYFrtF2oOI/AAAAAAAAAHo/BhsdjnczTwI/s320/blogski3.jpg" width="200" /></a><br /><div>Church of the Good Shepard</div></div><div class="image"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_-gckRFXob4c/SzYFwB8FPUI/AAAAAAAAAHw/kEx4erjEVy0/s1600-h/blogski4.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_-gckRFXob4c/SzYFwB8FPUI/AAAAAAAAAHw/kEx4erjEVy0/s320/blogski4.jpg" width="200" /></a><br /><div>Lake Tekapo</div></div><br />Later that night one of our party was fairly sick, we went to the local medical centre in Methven, but it was closed. There was no operating hours on the front door, nor was there even a phone number.<br />We asked one of the staff at our hotel, they said the nearest hospital was Ashburton, which was only 30min away. After driving around Ashburton a wee bit we found the hospital, and were informed there is no emergency department, we needed a referral from a GP!<br />Nearest emergency department was Christchurch, 1.5hrs away.<br /><br />02-09-09<br />Mt Hutt finally opened later in the day and we headed up. After figuring out how to walk in our ski equiptment we arrived at the magic carpet, once at the top of the beginners slope I pushed off, went 20m and fell over, while this was the only time I fell over, I wasn't stable for the next few days of skiing. This wasn't suprising as I am unable to rollerblade, rollerskate or ice skate despite numerous attempts. Though I can surf, so really should have ignored peoples concerns that snowboarders get more injured while learning and attempted snowboarding.<br />The others I was with were all avid rollerbladers and had no problems picking up skiing, they were weaving down the slopes in no time.<br /><div class="image"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_-gckRFXob4c/SzYF2SexzgI/AAAAAAAAAH4/4dimkTkX3p8/s1600-h/blogski5.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_-gckRFXob4c/SzYF2SexzgI/AAAAAAAAAH4/4dimkTkX3p8/s320/blogski5.jpg" width="200" /></a><br /><div>Beginners slope with the addition of school children</div></div><br />Two of my fellow travelers felt they had concurred the initial beginners slope, and attempted the second beginners slope. This really should have been called an intermediate slope, as unless you can steer and most importantly brake, you are in for serious trouble going down this slope. They were grossly under prepared, one made it down by steering himself into mountains of snow to slow himself down, the other came into the bottom of the slope at about 30kmh, and had to fall on his side and slide into skis, poles and snowboards of other peoples who were laying around the ski racks. Make sure you're ready before attempting the second beginners slow at Mt Hutt.<br /><div class="image"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_-gckRFXob4c/SzYF82YR61I/AAAAAAAAAIA/wZJbz3SvSG8/s1600-h/blogski6.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_-gckRFXob4c/SzYF82YR61I/AAAAAAAAAIA/wZJbz3SvSG8/s320/blogski6.jpg" width="200" /></a><br /><div>Bottom of the next level 'Beginners' slope</div></div><br />03-09-09<br />It was local schools excursion day and the beginners slope was packed with school kids, who all thought it a great idea to sit around their fallen comrades talking, which happened to be located all the way down the beginners slope, so now navigating your way down without hitting someone was near impossible if you hadn't mastered the art of steering, not just general steering, threading a needle kind of steering as the number of children was immense.<br />In Methven there is the Blue Pub and the Brown Pub. The Blue pub is a tourist attraction, higher prices kind of pub, the Brown pub is more a locals, decent prices option. We chose the Brown pub, the fish and chicken didn't taste like fish or chicken, but overall were decent meals. The chocolate volcano dessert was amazing.<br /><div class="image"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_-gckRFXob4c/SzYGBCTuZ_I/AAAAAAAAAII/t_FXnwnhF9g/s1600-h/blogski7.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_-gckRFXob4c/SzYGBCTuZ_I/AAAAAAAAAII/t_FXnwnhF9g/s320/blogski7.jpg" width="200" /></a><br /><div>Blue pub</div></div><div class="image"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_-gckRFXob4c/SzYGEDwQfzI/AAAAAAAAAIQ/No9Q4k94Bv8/s1600-h/blogski8.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_-gckRFXob4c/SzYGEDwQfzI/AAAAAAAAAIQ/No9Q4k94Bv8/s320/blogski8.jpg" width="150" /></a><br /><div>Brown pub, which is actually more an off white</div></div><br />04-09-09<br />More skiing today, minus the children sprouting up along the beginners slope, though after a few attempts I really wasn't enjoying the activity of skiing. The rest of the day I spent walking around taking photos and video of others skiing. For me, the effort and time taken to get to the top of the beginners slope isn't equally repaid by the short ski experience down, maybe I'm just not a skier.<br />Playing in the snow, snow angels, snow fights, snow men and sleding is more my style.<br /><div class="image"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_-gckRFXob4c/SzYGI99wHpI/AAAAAAAAAIY/pgmHjNkhFDM/s1600-h/blogski9.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_-gckRFXob4c/SzYGI99wHpI/AAAAAAAAAIY/pgmHjNkhFDM/s320/blogski9.jpg" width="150" /></a><br /><div>Snowman</div></div><div class="image"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_-gckRFXob4c/SzYGMdbR_jI/AAAAAAAAAIg/yg3oIVeesDk/s1600-h/blogski10.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_-gckRFXob4c/SzYGMdbR_jI/AAAAAAAAAIg/yg3oIVeesDk/s320/blogski10.jpg" width="150" /></a><br /><div>Snow Angel</div></div><div class="image"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_-gckRFXob4c/SzYGP7IoqoI/AAAAAAAAAIo/f4dMedi1dlI/s1600-h/blogski11.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_-gckRFXob4c/SzYGP7IoqoI/AAAAAAAAAIo/f4dMedi1dlI/s320/blogski11.jpg" width="150" /></a><br /><div>Snow Ball</div></div><br />05-09-09<br />Some of our party wanted to try other activities in their journey, so today consisted of jet boating along a canyon, horse back riding and clay pigeon shooting. All great activities and an alright price for tourist activities.<br /><div class="image"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_-gckRFXob4c/SzYGTtGfBbI/AAAAAAAAAIw/cjR12Jie0l0/s1600-h/blogski12.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_-gckRFXob4c/SzYGTtGfBbI/AAAAAAAAAIw/cjR12Jie0l0/s320/blogski12.jpg" width="200" /></a><br /><div>Jet boating</div></div><div class="image"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_-gckRFXob4c/SzYGYBt3frI/AAAAAAAAAI4/5bZYQVIlVqk/s1600-h/blogski13.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_-gckRFXob4c/SzYGYBt3frI/AAAAAAAAAI4/5bZYQVIlVqk/s320/blogski13.jpg" width="150" /></a><br /><div>Clay Pigeon shooting</div></div><div class="image"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_-gckRFXob4c/SzYGbfrKS7I/AAAAAAAAAJA/-yqRmYPG_FY/s1600-h/blogski14.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_-gckRFXob4c/SzYGbfrKS7I/AAAAAAAAAJA/-yqRmYPG_FY/s320/blogski14.jpg" width="200" /></a><br /><div>Shooting clay pigeons</div></div><div class="image"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_-gckRFXob4c/SzYGfhI1TuI/AAAAAAAAAJI/-GnxC8UFGfQ/s1600-h/blogski15.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_-gckRFXob4c/SzYGfhI1TuI/AAAAAAAAAJI/-GnxC8UFGfQ/s320/blogski15.jpg" width="200" /></a><br /><div>Horse riding, through a river.
