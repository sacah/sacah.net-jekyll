I was contacted out of the blue by a recruiter via LinkedIn, this recruiter worked for Booking.com and asked if I was interested in possibly taking a role in Amsterdam, Netherlands. I'd looked at going to Amsterdam for work before, so I asked for some more info and she sent over a brief job description. It was of a fairly standard Front End role, with an added emphasis on A/B testing.<br /><br />She then scheduled a Skype call a week away to discuss more and go over the relocation package. The call was pretty standard, asking about why I was interested, my current work place, previous experience, family etc. After the call I submitted my resume and she attached it to a job application, I'd recommend you click on the link in the confirmation email about the job application, and create a login and finish the application.<br /><br />A week later I get an email confirming my phone interview in a weeks time. It was with 2 Front End developers at Booking.com, they covered basic questions, focused a bit on A/B testing, how you use it, why you use it, metrics you'd look for in various situations, then went onto a small written test performed in a collaborative editor, so they could see me type.<br /><br />The next day I got a call from the lead recruiter, we talked for a bit, she told me more about what was on offer, talked a bit my history and family, then asked if I'd be interested in flying in to Amsterdam for the final interviews and meet with HR.<br /><br />A week after that all my travel arragements were agreed, and the next day I had plane tickets printed and ready to go for 3 weeks time.<br /><br />So after 22 hours travel I arrive in Amsterdam. I took the train, then metro to arrive a short walk to my hotel, make sure you have cash, and low denominations, many automatic machines only take 20 euro and below, and shops don't like to break notes.<br /><br />After a few days of looking around Amsterdam I went for my interview, it was 45min with HR, then 2 45min interviews with developers. Each interview had 2 developers, and it involved writing in paper some generic FE questions you can find by googling 'front end interview questions'. The other half of the interview was more interesting, asking about how you work with product owners, prioritising tasks, and why, business metrics and general questions about the accommodation industry.<br /><br />After those, there was a brief tour of the floors, then I was right to go and explore Amsterdam a bit more. They'd let me know in a week.
